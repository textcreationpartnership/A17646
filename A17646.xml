            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is ſufficiently knowne what</hi> part of <hi>Aſia</hi> the Galathians inhabited, and with what limits their Countrey was boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but whence they had their beginning, appeareth not ſo well among Writers. All a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that they were Gaules: and therof they were named Gaulegrecians. But out of what part of Gaule (or Fraunce) they came, they doe not ſo well agree. Strabo thought that the Tectoſages came out of Gaule Narbon, and that the other were Celtae: vvhome all for the moſte part haue followed. But vvheras Plinius reckoneth the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biani vvith t e Tectoſagi, and beſide that, by the conſent of all, that they had the Toliſtobogi to their fellowes, vvho dwelt vpon the borders of the Rhine: it ſemeth to me more likelye that they vvere the Belgae, inhabiting the farmoſt coaſt of the Rhine, toward the Brittaine Sea. For the Toliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tobogi held that portion in vvhich nowe the Cleueners and Brabanders do inhabite. But hereof ſprong the error, in my opinion: that whereas ſome band of the Tectoſages hadde made an inroade into Gaule Narbon, they retained their name, &amp; called the Region which they by force poſſeſſed, by it. And this doth <hi>Auſonius</hi> ſhew, where he ſayth, Euen ſo far as to the Teutoſagi who at the firſt were called Belgae. For he both calleth them Belgae: &amp; teſtifieth that in the beginning they vvere called Teutoſagi, who afterward were named Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoſagi. And whereas Caeſar doth place the Tectoſagi in the wood called Hercinia, I vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that to be done by going out of their own country thither: and by the ſtory you may alſo gather it. But as touching the originall of the Nation, more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſufficient hath ben ſpoken, as in regard of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent place. The Galathians which held that portion of <hi>Aſia</hi> which toke the nam of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as they wer deuided into 3. prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal peoples, namly the Tectoſages, Toliſtobogi, &amp; the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cmi, ſo alſo, ſaith Plinie, they had three principal Cities. They
<pb facs="tcp:7611:4"/> flouriſhed with ſo greate force once among their weake neighboures, that a great part of the leſſer <hi>Aſia</hi> vvas tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie to them: at length their Countreyes vertue wearing out, they gaue themſelues to delicacie and exceſſe. So vvith no great adoe they were ouercome in battayle, and ſubdew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Cneus Manlius,</hi> the Romane Conſul. in Saint Paule his tyme they were vnder the Romanes. Furthermore whereas he had purely and faithfully inſtructed them in the Goſpel: there came, while he was away the falſe Apoſtles, who cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the true ſeede (of the Word) with falſe and corrupt Doctrines. For they taught that the obſeruing of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies was as yet neceſſarie. It might ſeeme a thing of light ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in ſhewe. but Paule contendeth about it as a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall poynt of the chriſtian faith: and not without a cauſe, for it is no ſmal euill to ſmother the brightneſſe of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, to lay a ſnare vpon the conſciences, to take awaye the difference of the old and new Teſtament. he did ſee beſides this, that vnto theſe erroures there was ioyned alſo a wicked and hurtfull opinion of deſeruing righteouſneſſe. This is the cauſe why he ſtriueth with ſuche vehemencye and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. that we alſo being admoniſhed how waightye and ſerious a matter is here handled, maye be the more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to reade it. If a man eſtimate the cauſe by the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of Origen or Ierome, he ſhall wonder that Paule was ſo greatly moued for certaine outward cuſtomes. but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhall looke vpon the beginning it ſelfe, ſhall confeſſe that they were matters not vnmeete to be ſo ſharpely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended about. For in that the Galathians by ouer ſwift cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, nay rather by lightneſſe and folly ſuffered themſelues to be lead away from the truth: therefore he reprehendeth them the more ſharply<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I am not of their opinion, which ſuppoſe that they were the hardlyer handled for becauſe of the dulneſſe of their witte. The Epheſians and Coloſsians were aſſayed alſo. and if they had ſo lightly yielded to their deceites, thinke we that Paule would haue dealte any more mildely with them? The nature of the people then moued him not thus franklye to chide them, but it was rather the
<pb facs="tcp:7611:4"/> hatefulneſſe of the matter that enforced him. Now that we vnderſtande the cauſe why he wrote this Epiſtle: let vs come to the order of the handling thereof. He contendeth in the two firſte chapters about the authoritie of his Apoſtleſhip: ſauing that by occaſion, about the end of the ſecond chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he entreth into the principall (ſtate of the matter): that is to ſay into the queſtion of the iuſtification of man: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of neuertheleſſe at the laſt in the thirde chapter he openlye frameth a full diſputation. Although he ſeeme to intreate of many thinges in theſe two Chapters: yet this one thing he indeauoureth, to proue himſelfe equall with the higheſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: and that he lacketh nothing but that he maye bee reckoned an Apoſtle in like degree of honour, as they. But it is worth the while to know why hee tooke ſo great pains about the triall of his eſtimation. for ſo that Chriſt raigne, and that the puritie of doctrine remaine ſound, what ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it whether he be aboue Peter, or leſſe then Peter, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they bee all equall among themſelues? If all muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, that only Chriſt may encreaſe, vnfruitfull is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention about the dignitie of men. Moreouer this maye bee demaunded, why he compareth himſelfe to the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, for what controuerſie had he with Peter and Iames, and Iohn? to what purpoſe then did it belong, that thoſe who were of one mynde and good friendes among themſelues, ſhoulde be at oddes againſt themſelues? I aunſwere, that the falſe Apoſtles, who had beguiled the Galathians, to the end they might the better aduaunce themſelues, pretended the names of the Apoſtles, as though they had ben ſent of them. This was a notable ſhouldring in of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, for that they were beleeued to be the Apoſtles deputies, and ſpake as it vvere out of their mouth: and in the meane while did pluck away from Paule the name and right of an Apoſtle. For they did obiect that he was not choſen of the Lord, one of the twelue, that he was neuer acknowled to be ſuch an one by the colledge of the Apoſtles: and that not only hee had his doctrine not from Chriſt, but not ſo muche as from the Apoſtles, ſo came it to paſſe that not onelye the authoritie
<pb facs="tcp:7611:5"/> of Paul vvas diminiſhed: but that he was as ſome one of the multitude, much baſer then themſelues. If the matter had bene concearning perſons only, it had bene no great matter for Paule to haue bene reputed ſome common Diſciple: but vvhen he did ſee his Doctrine thereby beginne to grow out of credite, and to be ſet leſſe by: he ought not to holde his peace, but ſtoutlye ſpeake againſt it. This is the wylineſſe of the Deuill, vvhen he dareth not aſſayle the Doctrine mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly, vvith crooked mynes to hurle down the maieſtie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Let vs remember than, that in the perſon of Paule the truth of the Goſpell vvas aſſaulted, for if he had ſuffred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be ſpoyled of the honour of Apoſtleſhip, it followed that he had vſurped more hitherto than vvas his right. and this falſe boaſting woulde haue made him bene ſuſpected in other thinges alſo. And therupon alſo did hang the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his doctrine, in that it ſhould haue the beginning and was receaued not as proceeding from an Apoſtle of Chriſte, but from ſome common diſciple. On the otherſide hee was ouerwhelmed with the maieſtie of great names and ſtiles. For they wheras they boaſted them of the title of Peter and Iames and Iohn, did chalenge to themſelues Apoſtolicall authoritie. And had not Paule manfully reſiſted this boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, he ſhould haue geuen roome for a lye, and moreouer ſhould haue ſuffered in his owne perſon the truth to haue bene trodden downe. Therefore doth he ſeriouſly contend about both, (namely) that he was an Apoſtle appointed of the Lord, and alſo that he was nothing inferiour to the reſt: but that he was of like right and dignitie as they, euen as he had like name with them. He might haue denied either that they were ſent by Peter and his felowe Apoſtles, or that they had any commandement from them: but this defence hath much more waight, that he geueth not place to the Apoſtels themſelues: for if he had ſhunned that, he ſhould haue bene thought to haue diſtruſted his own cauſe. Ieruſalem in thoſe dayes was the mother of all Churches, for that the Goſpel did flowe from thence into the whole worlde, and it was as it weare the principall ſeate of the kingdome of Chriſte.
<pb facs="tcp:7611:5"/> Whoſoeuer came from thence into other Churches he vvas reuerently receiued, and not vvithout good cauſe. But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were ſwolne vvith a fooliſh glory, becauſe they vvere fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milier vvith the Apoſtles, or at the leaſtwiſe inſtructed by their teaching. Therfore nothing liked them, but that which they ſaw (done) at Ieruſalem. all other rites or vſages not there vſed, they not only reiected, but hardily alſo condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Such vvaywardneſſe is a plague very euill: vvhen vvee vvill haue the faſhion or cuſtome of one Church to ſtand as a generall law. And it riſeth of a prepoſterous zeale vvhen vve are ſo vvedded to ſome teacher or place, that vvithoute vvaying the matter, vve vvould bynde all places and all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the ſence and vvill of one man, and to the orders of one place, as to a generall or common rule, although ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is alway mingled to it: yea rather ouermuch vvayward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is full of ambition. But to returne to theſe falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: if onely vpon an ill emulation they had aſſayed in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place to thruſt in the vſage of the ceremonies, which they ſaw kept at Ieruſalem: in ſo doing they had done no ſmall offence. for it is iniurious of a cuſtom ſtraight vvay to make a rule. But there vvas more euill in their Doctrine being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and pernicious, for that they vvould holde the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences bounde by a religion, for that they placed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the obſeruation thereof. Nowe vve perceiue vvhy Paule vvas ſo ſtoute in the avouching his Apoſtleſhip, and vvhy he doth ſet himſelfe (by way of comparing) againſt the other Apoſtles. And that doth he til the ende of the ſecond Chapter, vvhere he maketh away ouer vnto the handling of the matter: namely that vve are iuſtified freely before God, not by the workes of the law. For he vſeth this argument, If ceremonies haue not power to iuſtifie, then the obſeruing of them is not neceſſarie. although he ſpeaketh not of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies alone, but reaſoneth generally of vvorkes: or elſe all his argument vvere caycolde. If this ſeeme vnto any to bee farre fetched, he muſt conſider two thinges. Firſt that hee could not otherwiſe diſpatche the queſtion, but by taking the generall principle (which is) We be iuſtified by the mere
<pb facs="tcp:7611:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> grace of God: vvhich excludeth not ceremonies onlye, but alſo other vvorkes. Secondly that Paule made not ſo muche adoe concerning ceremonies, as about the vvicked opinion of getting ſaluation by vvorkes. Lette vs marke then that Paule beginneth not at the egge (as they ſay): but he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of neceſſitie the very ſpring head: that the readers maye know, that contention is not moued here about the ſhadow of the aſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but about the greateſt matter of all, (namelye) By vvhat vvay vve ſhall get ſaluation. They are beguiled than vvho thinke that the Apoſtle keepeth himſelfe in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the perticuler queſtion concearning ceremonies: for he could not vvinde him out of it by it ſelfe. We haue the like example <hi>Act.</hi> 15.2. Strife and contention vvas moued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ceremonies, vvhether they vvere neceſſary to be kept: about diſcourſing vvherof the Apoſtles preach Of the yoke of the Law not able to be borne, Of the free remiſſion of ſinnes. To what purpoſe are theſe thinges? for it ſeemeth to be an abſurde digreſſing from the purpoſe: but it is not ſo. for the perticuler errour could not otherwiſe be ſoundlye confuted, but by taking in hand the generall principle. As for example, If I muſt reaſon about the forbidding of eating fleſh, I vvill make mention not onely of meates, but I vvill arme my ſelfe with the generall doctrine: how farre mans traditions ought to preuayle to the binding of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. and this will I take hold of, that there is one law giuer, vvhich hath power to ſaue and deſtroy. Let this be the ſum: Paule in this place reaſoneth from the generall to the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all negatiuely: vvhich is an ordinarie and moſt naturall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diſputing. But with vvhat teſtimonies and reaſons he proueth this ſentence, <hi>We are iuſtified by the only grace of Chriſt,</hi> vve ſhal ſee in his place. This he proſecuteth euen to the end of the third Chapter. In the beginning of the fourth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he intreateth of the right vſe of ceremonies, and vvhy they vvere ordained: vvhere alſo he ſheweth that they are now aboliſhed. For he muſt preuent this abſurditie, vvhich ſtraight vvay might haue come in any mans minde, To what end than vvere ceremonies? were they vnprofitable? did the
<pb facs="tcp:7611:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> Fathers occupie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in vaine? He determineth both breefelye. (namelye) that in their time they vvere not ſuperfluous &amp; alſo that now they are abrogated by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt: becauſe he is the truth and ende of them, wherefore he teacheth that we muſt abide in him. where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hee briefely toucheth, what our ſtate differeth from the ſtate of the Fathers. whereof it foloweth, that the doctrine of the falſe apoſtles, which darkeneth the brightneſſe of the Goſpel with the ſhadowes of the old Lawe, is a peruerſe and hurtfull doctrine. with his doctrine hee mingleth certayne exhortations to moue the affections. About the ende of the Chapiter he ſetteth out his matter with a fine and pleaſant allegorie. In the fifte chapiter he exhorteth to holde faſte the libertie purchaſed by the blood of Chriſt, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer not their conſciences to be entangled vvith the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of men. but yet withall he admoniſheth what is the lawfull meaſure of libertie. And vpon this occaſion he ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, which are the true exerciſes of Chriſtians: leaſt whileſte they are in vayne occupied about cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, they paſſe ouer thoſe things that are principall.</p>

                  <hi>Haue ſayde in</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, that <hi>Paule</hi> in hys ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations is wont to aſcribe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of an Apoſtle, that by his perſon he mighte get authorytie vnto hys doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. The authoritye of the perſon doth depende neither of the iudgment nor yet of the wil of men: but of the only calling of God, and therefore he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to be hearde, becauſe he is an Apoſtle. Let vs always holde this, That God alone is to be heard in the Churche, and he which is appointed by him a Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, euen Ieſus Chriſt. Therefore whoſoeuer he be that will take vppon him the place of a Teacher, muſt ſpeake in the name of GOD or of Chriſte: but becauſe among the <hi>Galathians <hi>Paules</hi>
                  </hi> callyng was more doubted than elſewhere it was: therefore to confirme the ſame, hee doeth expreſſe ſomewhat more heere than in other Epyſtles hee doeth: for hee doth not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7611:8"/> only affirme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was called by God: but on the contrary parte, he denieth that he was called eyther of men or by men. Here note that he ſpeaketh not of the common office of Paſtors, but of the office of an Apoſtle, the ſlaunderers durſt not vtterly ſpoyle him of the honour of the Miniſterie: only they did take away from him the name and right of an Apoſtle. I ſpeake now of the office of an Apoſtle in a proper ſignification: for it is two manner of waies take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſometime it ſignifieth any y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preachers of the Goſpel: but in this place ſpecially it ſignifieth a principall order in the Churche, ſo that <hi>Paule</hi> is equall to <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt of the twelue. That firſt member, That he was not called of men, hee had common with all the true Miniſters of Chriſt. As no man ought to take vnto himſelfe the honour: ſo is it not in the power of men to giue it vnto whome it pleaſeth them. It belongeth to God alone to rule his Church: therefore Calling cannot be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full but of him. And although a man be rightly ſometime called in reſpect of the Church, who notwithſtanding through a wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked deſire, and not of a good conſcience, doth come vnto the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie: yet neuertheleſſe <hi>Paule</hi> doth here ſpeake of the perfecte approbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his Calling, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whych nothing is lacking.

                  </label> doth it not fall out that the falſe apoſtles boaſt the ſelfe ſame thing alſo? I graunt it: yea and that more arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly, and with greater boldnes than the ſeruantes of the Lord dare: but the thing in deed fayleth to them, which <hi>Paule</hi> myght openly ſhew. The ſecond member, That he was not called by man, doth peculierly belong to the Apoſtles: neyther ſhould this (namely to be called by man) haue been at that time a fault in a Paſtor. <hi>Paule</hi> himſelfe with <hi>Barnabas</hi> did make Elders by elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in euery towne <hi>Act. 14.23.</hi> the ſame he doth commaund to bee done of <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Timothie. <hi>1. Tim. 5.17. Tit. 1.3.</hi>
                  </hi> And this is the ordinary way to elect Paſtors: for we muſt not waite, till God doth reueale from heauen, thoſe whome he will choſe. Why then doth <hi>Paule</hi> reiect from hym that which is not onely not euill, but alſo laudable? I haue already ſhewed that <hi>Paule</hi> thought it not ſufficient, if he had taken himſelfe either a Paſtor or any one of the Miniſters of the Goſpell: for he ſpeaketh (and the controuerſie was) about the office of an Apoſtle, and Apoſtles muſt be otherwiſe choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> than Paſtors, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſay immediatly (as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7611:8"/> they terme it) of the Lord himſelfe, <hi>Mat. 10.1.</hi> So Chriſt hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe choſe the twelue: <hi>Act. 1.23.</hi> and when a ſucceſſor was to bee pacled in ſtead of <hi>Iudas,</hi> the Church durſt not chooſe one by elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but, flieth to lottes. Certayne it is that there was no lottes vſed in the choſing of Paſtors: why do they it then in the orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Mathias?</hi> forſooth that he might be choſen of God: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the office of an Apoſtle muſt bee diſcerned from the other miniſteries (or offices.) Therefore to the end that <hi>Paule</hi> might exempt himſelfe from the common order of Miniſters, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiectiō. </seg>
                  </label> he conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that his Calling is immediate from God. But how doth hee deny himſelfe to be called by men, when as <hi>Luke</hi> doth ſhew <hi>Act. 22.21.26.</hi> that he an5d <hi>Barnabas</hi> were called by the Church of <hi>Antiochia?</hi> Some anſwere, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwere. </seg>
                  </label> that he had the function of the office of an Apoſtle before (that time:) and therefore that that Calling was not the foundation of his Apoſtleſhip. But then agayne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception myght be made, that at that time he was firſt appoynted an Apoſtle to the <hi>Gentils:</hi> in which number the <hi>Galathians</hi> were. Therefore the truer and playner anſwere is, that he would not exclude heere vtterly the Calling of the Church: but only ſhew that his Apoſtleſhyppe reſted vppon a greater prerogatiue, the which is true: For the <hi>Antiochians</hi> did not lay their handes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <hi>Paule</hi> of theyr owne heads,<note place="margin">An oracle is a ſpech from god.</note> but being commaunded by an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. Becauſe therefore that he was called by Diuine Reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and after that was appointed and called the Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentils</hi> by the holy Ghoſt: it foloweth that he was not brought in by men, howſoeuer the ſolemne vſage of ordayning was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward added. If the indirecte contrarietye betweene <hi>Paule</hi> and the falſe Apoſtles pleaſe any manne, I gaineſay it not: becauſe they boaſted of the name of men, it ſhall bee thus, as though hee ſaide, Of whomſoeuer they boaſt themſelues to be ſent, I cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly will be aboue them, becauſe I haue a commaundement from God and Chriſte. <hi>By Ieſus Chriſte and God the father.</hi> Hee maketh God the Father and Chriſt the authors of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtleſhip. He nameth Chriſt firſt, becauſe it belongeth to him to ſend, and we do our ambaſſage for him. But to amplify it, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth alſo the father: as if he ſhould ſay, If the maieſtie of Chriſt ſuffice not, let them know alſo, that my office is enioyned me by God the Father <hi>which hath raiſed him.</hi> Not without cauſe in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7611:9"/> this place doth he make mention of the reſurrection: for it is the beginning of the kingdome of Chriſte. Therefore did they light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteeme <hi>Paule,</hi> in that he was not conuerſant with Chriſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon earth: he on the contrary part doth ſignify, that Chriſt, as by his reſurrection he is glorified, ſo verily and in deed at length ſhewed foorth his power in ruling the Church. Therefore more dignity hath <hi>Paule</hi> his calling, than if he had been ordained of Chriſt while he was yet mortall. And this circumſtance is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy noting, becauſe <hi>Paule</hi> doth couertly ſhewe the wonderfull power of God, which appeared in the reſurrection of Chriſte, to be hatefully ſpoken againſt of his backbiters: becauſe the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father which hath raiſed Chriſte from death, euen he hath appointed <hi>Paule</hi> a preacher of that his power.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2. And the brethren which are with me.</hi> He ſemeth to haue written in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of many: (for this cauſe) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if they did attribute litle to him alone, that yet at the leaſtwiſe they ſhould harken to many, and not deſpiſe the whole congregation. And he is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed rather about the end to wryte ſalutations from the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, than to ioyne them to him in the beginning as partners of his wryting, at the leaſt he nameth not aboue two at any time, which two are well knowne, but here he doth otherwiſe, for hee comprehendeth all, which I thinke is not done without cauſe: for the conſent of ſo many godly perſons ought ſomwhat to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile with the <hi>Galathians,</hi> to make them apt to be enformed and to be tractable. <hi>To the Churches.</hi> It was a large countrey, and therefore had many diſperſed congregations: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiectiō. </seg>
                  </label> but it is maruaile that this title is graunted to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> who almoſte were ſhronke away from Chriſt, for where the Church is, there is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of faith. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwere. </seg>
                  </label> I anſwere, In as much as there was among them the profeſſion of Chriſtianitye, the inuocation of one God, the vſe of the Sacramentes, and a Miniſterie, ſuch as it was, that there were remaining as yet ſome markes of a Church. There is not in al Churches then, that purity alwayes that may be required. Thoſe which are moſt pure haue their blemiſhes: other ſome are not only full of ſpottes, but almoſte deformed. It is not meete therefore that wee ſhould ſo be offended with the faultes of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and manners, that if all thinges like vs not in euery Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, we ſhould ſtraight way take from them the name of a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7611:9"/> Churche. <hi>Paule</hi> in this place doth teache vs another manner of kindneſſe, neuertheleſſe ſo are thoſe Congregations which are faulty to be acknowledged as the Churches of Chriſte, that we notwithſtanding condemne whatſoeuer is euyll in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: neither is it thus, that where there is a Church, whatſoeuer one it bee, there is perfection of all thoſe thinges which are to be wiſhed in the Church. This I ſpeake therefore, becauſe the Papiſtes cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this word <hi>(Church)</hi> will haue eſtablyſhed whatſoeuer they luſt to thruſt in: although there be great diuerſity between the eſtate &amp; faſhion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Galatia.</hi> If <hi>Paule</hi> liued at theſe dayes, he ſhoulde perceiue there miſerable ruines of the Church, and horrible waſte and ſpoile, but no building. If you had rather haue it more briefly, it is called the Church by the figure <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> where there is ſome portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a Church,<note place="margin">Synecdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is a Figure whereby parte is put for the whole.</note> although all thinges anſwere not fully in it.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3. Grace be vnto you &amp; peace.</hi> I haue ſpoken of this maner of ſalutation in other epiſtles. I remaine in opinion, that <hi>Paule</hi> wiſheth God mercifull to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> &amp; after that, all things to be proſperous: ſith that out of God his beneuolence, floweth vnto vs the happy ſucceſſe of all thinges. He wiſheth both, from the Father and alſo from Chriſte, becauſe that without Chriſt there is neither grace nor any good ſucceſſe.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4. Which hath giuen himſelfe.</hi> He commendeth here from the beginning the grace of Chriſt, that he may cal back y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Galathians</hi> vnto him, &amp; retayne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in him. For if they had worthely conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this benefite of redemption, they would neuer haue fallen to ſtrange obſeruations. For he which knoweth Chriſt aright, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him with tooth &amp; naile, embraceth him with both armes, is occupied wholy in him, deſireth nothing beſide him. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is a very good remedy, wherwith we may purge our minds of all kind of errors &amp; ſuperſtitions, (namely) to bring into mynd what Chriſte is vnto vs, &amp; what he hath brought vnto vs. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it a ſmall thing that is ſignified in theſe words, Whiche hath giuen himſelfe for our ſinnes: for he would premoniſh the <hi>Galathians</hi> that the purging of ſinnes, &amp; by that meanes perfect righteouſneſſe is no where els to be ſought, but in Chriſte: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath offred himſelfe for a ſacrifice to his Father, &amp; ſuch an Hoſte, as to ſet any other ſatiſfactions againſt it, were wrong
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7611:10"/> and wickednes: moreouer that this Redemption is of ſo great worthines, that it ought wholy to rauiſh vs into the admiration thereof. But that which in this place <hi>Paule</hi> aſcribeth to Chriſt, the ſcripture elſewhere applieth to God the father, and both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly. For both the Father by his eternall counſell hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined this Purging and ſatiſfaction for vs, &amp; in this hath wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed his loue toward vs, that he hath not ſpared his onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſonne, but hath giuen him for vs: And Chriſt hee offered himſelfe a ſacrifice to reconcile vs to God, <hi>Rom. 8.31.</hi> whereof foloweth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his death is a ſatiſfaction for ſinnes. <hi>That he might take vs.</hi> Hee alſo declareth the end of our Redemption: that Chriſte hath gayned vs vnto hym by hys death to bee hys owne. That co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe when we are ſeparated from the world, for as long as we are of the world we partayne not to Chriſt. This word World is taken here for the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is in the world as, <hi>1. Io. 5.19.</hi> where it is ſayd, That the whole world is layd in wickednes, and in many other places. It is otherwiſe taken in the Goſpel, whereas Chriſt ſayth, I pray not that thou take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the world: but that thou keepe them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euill. <hi>Io. 17.15.</hi> for there he ſignifieth the preſent life. What then is the World in this place? Men ſeparated from the kingdome of God and the grace of Chriſte. For a man as long as he liueth to himſelfe, is totally damned. The World then &amp; Regeneration are thinges oppoſite or contrary: as alſo Nature and Grace, the Fleſh and the Spirite. And therefore they that are borne of the Worlde, haue nothing but ſinne and wyckednes: not by creation, but by corruption. Chriſte then hath died for our ſinnes, that he might redeeme or ſeparate vs from the World. <hi>Wicked.</hi> He addeth this epithete or title, to ſhew that he ſpeaketh of the corruption or wyckednes that commeth of ſinne, and not of the creature of God, or of corporall life. And yet wyth this one woorde, as with the ſtroke of a thunderbolt he hurleth downe all the pryde of man. For he witneſſeth, that without the renewing which is by the Grace of Chriſte, there is nothing in vs but meere wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe. For we are of the World: and vntill Chryſte take vs out of it, the World raigneth in vs, and we liue vnto it. Howe much ſoeuer then menne pleaſe themſelues, they are but miſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous and wicked with all their iolittye. Vnto themſelues
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7611:10"/> they ſeeme not ſuche: but let it ſuffice vs, that the Lord doeth ſo ſpeake it by the mouth of <hi>Paule. According to the will.</hi> Hee ſheweth the firſt ſpring of grace to be the purpoſe of God: for ſo God loued the world that he gaue his only begotten ſonne, <hi>Io. 3.16.</hi> But it is to be noted that <hi>Paule</hi> is accuſtomed to ſet the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God agaynſt all deſertes or merites of men. So Wyll ſignifieth here in this place that whyche commonly they call the Good Pleaſure. The ſence than is, That Chriſt ſuffered for vs, not becauſe we were worthy, or becauſe wee brought any thing whyche myght prouoke hym: but becauſe the Counſell of God was ſo. <hi>Of God and our father,</hi> is as muche as if it had been ſaide of God which is our father.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>5.

I wonder that.</hi> He beginneth with chiding, which chiding is ſomewhat more gentle than they deſerued: but his vehement chiding he had rather beſtowe vpon the falſe Apoſtles, as we ſhal ſee. He reprehendeth them for theyr ſhrinking away, not from his doctrine only, but from Chriſt. For they might not otherwiſe hold Chriſte, than to acknowledge vs by his benefite to be ſet at liberty from the bondage of the Law: but the neceſſity which the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7611:11"/> falſe Apoſtles did put in ceremonies was vtterly contrary, and ſo they were caried ouer from Chriſte, not becauſe they did alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether caſt away Chriſtianitie, but becauſe in ſuche corruption there was only left vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a counterfeite Chriſt. So at theſe dayes the Papiſtes, becauſe they will haue a halfe Chriſt, and a torne Chriſt, haue no Chriſt: and therefore they are caried ouer from Chriſt, for they are full of ſuperſtitious, which are directly contrary wyth the nature of Chriſt. This muſt be dilligently marked, <hi>That we are caried ouer fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt,</hi> when we fal vnto thoſe thinges which are contrary to his office: for light cannot be mingled with darkenes. After the ſame reaſon is it, that hee calleth it another goſpell, that is, contrary to the true goſpell: &amp; yet the falſe apoſtles did profeſſe themſelues to preach the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Chriſt: but whereas they did mingle their fayned deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, wherewith they deſtroye the principall force of the Goſpell, therefore they had a falſe, a corrupt, and a counterfeyte goſpell. He vſeth the word of the preſent time, as though their fall were now in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doing: as though he ſhould ſay, I ſay not that ye are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready carried ouer, for then it were more hard for you to returne into the way: but now, whileſt you are yet in the middeſt of your courſe, drawe backe your feet rather than go forward. Some reade, <hi>From him that hath called you in the grace of Chriſt,</hi> meaning of the father: but the reading which I followe is more playn. In that he ſaith, that they were called of Chriſt by grace, it ſerueth to vpbrayde theyr vnthankfulneſſe. To fall from the Sonne of God, of it ſelfe is euill &amp; wycked, but to fall from hyme when hee hath called vs freely to ſaluation, is much more hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, for his goodneſſe towards vs augmenteth the greatneſſe of our wyckednes, if we be vnthankefull. <hi>Soone.</hi> He augmenteth the foulenes of their inconſtancye.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7611:11"/> touching the expoſition of the words, take it more ſimply: for he ſpeaketh contemptuouſly of the doctrine of the falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that it is onely a matter of troubles and deſtruction, as though he ſhould ſay, What bring theſe men? What cauſe haue they to gaynſay the doctrine by me taught? Forſooth they trouble you, and ouerthrowe the Goſpell, and nought els doe they. The ſenſe notwithſtanding commeth to one poynt: for I graunt that by this kinde of ſpeaking is corrected that which was ſpoken of another Goſpell. He denieth it therefore to be the Goſpell, but a mere perturbation and trouble. Onely I was willing to admoniſh that <hi>Aliud</hi> here in this place is (after my iudgement) taken for <hi>Alia res,</hi> that is in Engliſh, Another thing, as we are accuſtomed to ſaye, That is no other thing but that you wil play the deceiuer. <hi>Are willing to ouerthrow.</hi> He layeth the ſeconde accuſation agaynſt them, that they doe Chriſt wrong, willing to ouerthrowe his Goſpell. It is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous great accuſation, for ouerthrowing is more then corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Neither yet doth he vndeſeruingly lay it to their charge. For Chriſt doth not ſtande, and the doctrine of the Goſpell fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, where as the prayſe of mans iuſtifying is tranſpoſed to other, and where the conſciences are ſnarled and entangled. We muſt alwaye beholde what are the ſpecialleſt things in the Goſpell, ſurely he that ouerthroweth theſe is a deſtroyer of the Goſpell. The name of Chriſt which is added, maye be two wayes expounded, other for that it commeth from Chriſte the Author: or that it doth purely ſhewe Chriſt. But no doubte he woulde ſhew by this epithet the true and natural goſpel, which ought to be accounted but one.</p>

                  <hi>8 But although we.)</hi> Here he aſſayleth them with greate boldneſſe, to defende the authoritie of his doctrine. And firſt he affirmeth the doctrine by him preached, to be that only goſpell, which to empeyre were great wickedneſſe. Or elſe the falſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles might aunſwere him and ſay: Wee alſo wiſhe the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to remayne pure and vncorrupt, neither iudge we leſſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable of it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou. As at theſe dayes the Papiſts exclaime, that the goſpell is holden holy among them, and that they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the name thereof with great reuerence: but when you come to the triall of it, then doe they turmoile the pure &amp; plaine
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7611:12"/> doctrine of the Goſpell as they were wood. Therefore Paule not content with that generall teſtification, doth define what maner of thing that Goſpell is, and what it conteineth, and he pronounceth his doctrine to be the true Goſpell, leſt it ſhould be ſought els where. For what ſhall it profite to giue our conſent to the Goſpell, and wot not what it meaneth? Among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes peraduenture it might ſerue,<note place="margin">A folded or hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> truth</note> where <hi>Fides implicita</hi> is in force: but among Chriſtians there is no fayth, where there is no knowledge. Therfore leſt the Galathians, beeing otherwiſe ready to obey the Goſpell, ſhould wauer hither and thither, and beeing in doubt ſhould not finde where to ſet faſt footing, Paul biddeth them bide in his doctrine. Further he will haue ſuche credite giuen to his preaching, that he pronounceth a curſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon all them that dare ſpeake agaynſt it. Yea and he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with him ſelfe, becauſe it was needefull, for ſo he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteth the reproche wherewith his yll willers woulde haue burdened him: (as thus) Thou wilt haue receiued without controuerſie whatſoeuer commeth from thee, becauſe it is thine. Therefore to ſhewe that he maketh no account of him ſelfe in this caſe, he taketh euen from him ſelfe power, whereby he might dare do any thing agaynſt this doctrine. He doth not by this meanes make other his inferiors or ſubiectes: but with him ſelfe he bringeth all others into frame, as meete it is, to be ſubiectes to the worde of God. But to the intent that with greater force he might caſt downe the falſe Apoſtles, he clim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth vp euen to the Angelles: neither doth he ſimplye denye them to be hearde, if they bring anye other thing, but he ſayth they ought to be curſed. This maye ſeeme vnto ſome an abſurditie, that he ioyneth the Angels in triall with his doctrine: but he that doth rightly waye all thinges, ſhall ſee that he did it needefully. Sure it is that the Angels of heauen can bring no other ſaue the certayne trueth of God: but where the contention was about the credite of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine reuealed by God for the ſaluation of men: he thoughte it not inoughe to exempte the ſame from the iudgement of men, excepte he affirmed it alſo about the Angels. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when as he pronounceth the iudgement of a curſe vppon Angels, if they teache any other thing: although it be an

He ſawe both him ſelfe and it, to be preaſſed with the highe titles of men, he aunſwereth, that not euen the Aungels haue any weighte or authoritie to treade downe his doctrine. Neither dothe he iniurie to the Angels, for ſithe they were created to ſet foorth the glory of God by all meanes that maye be, he which to this ende dothe holily abuſe their name, diminiſheth nothing their dignitie. And hereof we not onely gather howe great the Maieſtie of the worde of God is, but our fayth alſo taketh a ſingular confirmation, whyleſt that we vſing the worde of God, maye ſafely triumph ouer the Angels and curſe them.</p>

He dothe therefore commaunde that they ſhoulde be helde for diuels whatſoeuer they bee, that dare bring an other goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell contrarie to hys, calling that another, vnto whiche the inuentions of others are patched. Neither was the doctrine of the falſe Apoſtles altogeather repugnaunt or contrarye, but it was corrupted with falſe additions. The ſhift therefore of the Papiſts is childiſh, wheras they dally thus with Paules words, Firſt that his whole preaching is not extant: neither that it can be knowen what it conteined, except the Galatians which heard it might be rayſed vp fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead for to be witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: moreouer that it is not forbidden, but that ſomwhat may be added: but only this y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other goſpels are conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned.

                  </gap>. Paule ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not of the argument of his preaching, but of the purpoſe of his minde, that he hath regard vnto God rather then vnto men, although the doctrine be aunſwerable to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> affection of him that teacheth. For as corruption of doctrine ſpringeth of ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarice, or any other wicked deſire, ſo a right co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience maketh y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the pure truth is retained. Therfore he enforceth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his doctrine is true, in that it is not conformed vnto men. <hi>Or do I ſeeke to pleaſe men?</hi> This ſecond differeth not much from the firſt: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it differeth ſomwhat: for the deſire to get fauor is the cauſe why we ſpeake after men. Where ſuch ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in our harts, that we couet to frame our ſpeeche to win the fauour of men, it may not be that we can teach ſincerely. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Paule doth teſtifie himſelfe to be pure and free from this vice, and that he may with the more boldneſſe attempt himſelfe alſo from ſlaunder he ſpeaketh aſking the queſtion: For queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons haue more waight, for that we giue our aduerſaries leaue to ſpeake againſte vs if they haue any thing (to ſay.) For that was a ſigne of great ſuertie, which the teſtimony of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience gaue to Paule: becauſe, indeede, he knewe himſelfe ſo to haue done his duety, that he was not in daunger of ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche. <hi>For if I ſhould pleaſe men.</hi> A ſentence worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce: that the ambitious, that is, they which hunt after the fauour of men, cannot ſerue Chriſte: Notwithſtanding hee ſpeaketh of his owne perſon ſingulerly in this ſence, that hee hath willingly put himſelfe out of fauour with men, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might giue himſelfe to ſerue Chriſt: and compareth the ſtate of his life afore, with his life nowe. He was in verye great eſtimation, he was receiued in euerye place with great applaudings and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes, wherefore if he would haue pleaſed men, he needed not chaunge his eſtate, But hereof is to be gathered that generall doctrine which I ſpake of: Whoſoeuer will faithfullye ſerue Chriſt, they muſt couragiouſly contemn the fauour of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This worde, Men, hath in this place a certaine note: for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or ſeruauntes of Chriſt may not purpoſely deſyre to pleaſe men: but there are diuers ſortes of men. Looke whome Chriſte is pleaſaunt vnto, let vs ſtudy to pleaſe them in Chriſte: they that will haue true Doctrine ſet behinde their affections, them
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7611:14"/> in no wiſe muſt we obay. And truly this battayle muſt alwayes be ſuſtayned of Godly and ſound Paſtors, that they ſet noughte by the offending of them, which will haue what they liſt in all thinges. For the Church ſhall alwaye haue Drones and wicked perſons, which will preferre their owne will before the worde of God. Yea and the good men are ſometyme tempted of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, ſo that they be angry with their Paſtor that aduiſeth them rightly: whether they doe it of ignoraunce, or of infirmitie. It is our partes therefore not to be afrayde of any offence, ſo that thereby we doe not alienate the weake from Chriſt. Manye doe otherwiſe expounde this place, as though it were <hi>Conceſſio,</hi> (that is a graunting or yielding) and they thinke this the ſence, If I didde pleaſe men, <hi>Then I were not the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunte of Chriſte:</hi> I graunte it. But who will vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brayde this vnto mee? Who ſeeth not that I ſeeke not the fauoure of menne?

Let the Readers therefore remember to reade his whole narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion together: and ſo therevpon to conclude of the whole, and not of the ſinguler partes. <hi>Which had ſeperated me.)</hi> This ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration was the councell of God whereby Paule was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the office of an Apoſtle, before he did know himſelfe to bee borne a man: His calling afterward followed in due time, when as the Lord manifeſted his will as touching him, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to be in a readineſſe vnto his worke. But there is no doubt, but that God, before the worlde was made, determyned what he woulde doe with euery one of vs, and aſſigned by his ſecret iudgement to euery one his duety and charge. But other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while the ſcripture doth vſe to place theſe three degrees: The eternall predeſtination of God: his appoynting from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe: and calling which is the effecte and fulfilling of both. The Lord ſpeaketh ſomewhat otherwiſe, <hi>Ieremy</hi> the firſt chap. the fift ver. that the wordes of Paule doe ſounde: and yet in the ſame ſence or meaning. Before y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I did ſhape thee in thy mothers wombe, I did know thee: before thou cameſt oute of thy mothers wombe I ſanctified thee: I gaue thee to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to the Nations or Gentils. God alſo ſanctified Paule not yet borne, to the office of an Apoſtle as he did <hi>Ieremie</hi> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> office of a Prophet, but he again is ſaid to ſeparat vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our mothers wombe, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to this end we are brought forth into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, that he might fulfil in vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he hath determined. And our calling is deferred euen vntill it be a fitte time to execute, when
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7611:16"/> as God hath made vs meete to fulfill that office which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyneth vs. Thus therefore may you reſolue Paules wordes, When it pleaſed God to reueale his ſonne by me, which called me, as before he did ſeperate me. For he would declare his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to depende vpon the ſecret election of God: neither that he was therefore appoynted an Apoſtle, becauſe he had prepared himſelfe by his owne induſtrie to take vpon him ſo great an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: or els becauſe God had found him meete, as to whom he might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit this buſines: but becauſe he was appoynted ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto by the hidden counſell of God, &amp; that before he was borne: For ſo he is accuſtomed to aſcribe the cauſe of his calling, to the free pleaſure of God: which is diligently to be marked. For therby we are taught, that it is to be referred to the grace of God, not onely that we are elected and adopted vnto eternall life: but alſo that he vouchſafeth to vſe our helpe, wheras other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we are vtterly vnprofitable: and that he aſſigneth vs a lawfull calling, in which we may exerciſe our ſelues. For what had Paule beeing not yet borne that was worthy of ſo great honour? Thus then muſt we make our count, that this is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the gifte of God, and not gotten by our power, that we are called to gouerne his Church. Finally in that ſome do more ſubtilly diſpute in the worde, Seperated, they do it without cauſe, and out of ſeaſon. Neither is God ſayd to ſeperate vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth put into vs ſome habite or forme, wherby we may differ from other: but becauſe he doth order vs by his counſell. Although verily he had already manifeſtly inoughe attributed his calling to the grace &amp; fauour of God, when he made the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning thereof that voluntary ſeparation from his mothers wombe: yet agayne by name doth he expreſſe it, partly that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation of the grace might take away al opnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of boſting, partly that he might teſtifie his thankfulnes to God.

Moreouer the coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth more moue me that Peter was reprehended at Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia what time as Paule did abide there, and that was before he was ſent to Ieruſalem of the Churches, to diſpatche y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion ariſen about ceremonies.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7611:18"/> voyage taken by the common conſent of the faythfull, letting paſſe the cauſe, and ſuppreſſing ſo memorable an ende. And it appeareth not ſufficiently at what time this Epiſtle was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: but that the Greekes do coniecture it to be ſent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome: and the Latines from Epheſus.

Surely this one word wold haue ſtopped their mouth, ye obiect to me y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles: but all men know what they haue iudged: therefore I holde you conuict of a ſhameleſſe lie.

We ſhall ſee what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at laſt, for the Apoſtles did not thinke it blame worthye, in that he had begun without their commaundement: but without controuerſie or quarelling, they ratified that which he had done, and that by the inſtinction of the ſame ſpirite, who being guide, Paule came vnto them. He was not therefore made of them an Apoſtle, but ſo acknowledged: but theſe thinges ſhall be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned afterwarde. <hi>Leaſt by any meanes.</hi> What then? ſhall the truth of God fall, except it be ſtayde by the teſtimony of men? but although the whole world be faithleſſe, yet for all that the truth of God remayneth ſure and vncorrupted, neyther doe they loſe their labour which by the commaundement of God do teach the Goſpell, although they bring forth no fruite by their labor, neither doe the words of Paule tende to this ende: but for that, as touching men, the miniſterie of the worde is vnprofitable to doubtfull and wauering conſciences. <hi>To runne in vaine,</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to labour without profite, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as that edifiing which ought (to follow) doth not enſue. Farthermore here was a ſtrong en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to ſhake weake conſciences, when as the deceauers did falſely ſay that the Doctrine which Paule did preach, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the doctrine of the Apoſtles: in ſo much that many did fall. The certaintie of faith dependeth not vpon the conſent of men: but rather ſo muſt we reſt in the naked truth of God, that neither men, neither all the Aungels ſhould remoue vs from it. Notwithſtanding to the rude, and thoſe which haue ſcarſely yet a ſmall taſte of ſounde doctrine, and haue not vtterlye dronke in the ſame in their harte and marow, this temptation can ſcant be born when they heare the principal teachers to be at ods among themſelues. Nay rather ſometimes Sathan by his ſubtiltie prouoketh and ſtirreth thoſe that be ſtrong, when as he layeth before them the contentions and diſſentions of them, whome it moſte became to thinke and ſpeake one thing. It can hardlye be tolde, how many that vnlucky contention as touching the<note n="*" place="margin">He mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the body of Chriſt.</note> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, ſtopped from the Goſpell, how many mens fayth it ſhaked: for that they ſaw men of principall authoritie ſo enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to ſtriue about the greateſt queſtion, againe it is no ſmall
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7611:19"/> helpe to eſtabliſh fayth when all teachers conſent in one. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whereas Sathan went about with ſuch ſubteltie to let the paſſage of the goſpell, Paule would ſtoppe him. for after that it appeared that he agreede well with all the Apoſtles, this lette was vtterly taken away, the mindes of the vnlearned were not toſſed any more with ſhifting and chaunging whom they ſhould follow. This is then that which he ſpeaketh, Leaſte my paynes which before I tooke had bene loſt, and finallye leaſt I ſhoulde goe forwarde without commoditie: I tooke away that doubte that troubled many: whether they might beleeue me or Peter. for with one conſent haue we (both) embraced that which I had alwayes taught. And if ſo be it were ſo great pleaſure to many at theſe dayes to edifie as it was to Paule, they woulde be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with greater care to agree among themſelues.</p>

This ſecond ſence liketh me. that Paule, vnderſtanding their laying in waight, would not circumciſe Titus. He ſayth that he was not compelled, that the readers may perceaue that Circumciſion of it ſelf was not condemned, as though it were a thing euil: but that they contend about the neceſſitie of keping it. as though he ſhould ſay.

For if hee had graunted this to his aduerſaries. that he had profited vnder the Apoſtles, hee had armed them with two ſlaunders: for by and by they would haue ſayde, At length thou haſt ſomething profited, that thou mightſt correct that which thou haddeſt before offended (in) and that thou mightſt pluck back thy foote fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy raſh enterpriſe.

He doeth not ſaye, that he careth not what maner of men they be at this preſente, but hee ſpeaketh of the time paſt, in whiche they were alreadye Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, he himſelfe being a ſtraunger from the fayth of Chriſt. In ſumme: Hee will not haue them iudge after the tyme paſt, nor yet that that prouerbe ſhoulde bee of force in this cauſe: That hee which is before in Tyme, ſhoulde be more abled in Righte. <hi>The perſon of a man.)</hi> Beſides the expoſitions whiche I haue already brought, this thirde alſo hath ſome ſhew, That in the Worldes pollicie or gouernment <hi>perſons</hi> haue place: but in the Spirituall kingdome of Chriſt they oughte to giue place. That is plauſiblye ſayde. but the Lorde ſpeaketh of Worlde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye policye or gouernment when hee ſayeth, Thou ſhalte not accepte a perſon in iudgement. Deut. the tenth Chapt. and the ſeuenteenth ver. But I enter not into that Diſputation: becauſe it maketh nothing to this preſent place. for Paule doth ſimply vnderſtande, that that degree of Honoure into whiche the Apoſtles were come before, didde not lette that hee ſhoulde not be called of GOD, and of a man of no accounte, ſhoulde of a ſodayne be made equall vnto them. (and) although there were great difference, that that auayled nothing before God, who is not ledde with the accepting of perſons. and whoſe calling is in daunger of no preiudices.

But godlyneſſe, a right zeale, holyneſſe, and other like giftes did get vnto the Apoſtles ſpeciall fauour and honour. and Paule trulye ſpeaketh as contemptuouſlye in this place, as though there had bene nothing in them but outward ſhewes. I aunſwere, That Paule doth eſtimate in this place the Apoſtles after the value they were of, but according to the vayn boaſting of his aduerſaries. for to the ende they might ſell their ſmoke, with full mouthes they thundered out the names of Peter, Iames, and Iohn: and that reuerence which the Churche did giue vnto them, thoſe (his Aduerſaryes) did ambitiouſlye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe, to the contempte of Paule. He doeth not therefore in this place diſpute what kynde of men the Apoſtles were, ne yet what his opinyon is of them, this contention being fet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte: but he confuteth thoſe outwarde ſhowes which the falſe Apoſtles did pretende. Therefore euen as afterwarde hee will intreate of Circumciſion, not according to the proper fence thereof, but according to the falſe and vngodly opinyon which thoſe deceauers deuiſed: euen ſo now alſo pronounceth he of the Apoſtles. that the outwarde ſhewes wherewith they ſhined in the worlde are nothing in the ſight of God. and that appeareth by the wordes. for why did they preferre them before Paule? forſooth becauſe they were afore him. This was meerelye an outwarde ſhewe. Otherwiſe no doubte but Paule according to his ſinguler modeſtye woulde haue honoured them with his harte, and haue embraced the giftes of GOD in them, who <hi>1.</hi> Cor. <hi>15.9.</hi> of his accord doth graunt himſelfe to be the leſt of the Apoſtles, and vnworthy to be accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted of ſo noble an order. <hi>Conferred nothing to me.</hi> It might alſo be thus read <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred nothing with me.</hi> for it is the ſame worde which twiſe before he hath vſed. The ſence notwithſtanding is certayne, that the Apoſtles hauing heard Paules Goſpell, pronounced not their Goſpell againſte it (as men accuſtomed when anye thing they haue better and more perfect) but being content to expounde the ſame, haue embraced his doctrine ſimplye and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7611:22"/> without delay: ſo that as in a thing neuer a whitte doubtfull, there was no alteration betweene them. And yet that Paule tooke not vpon him the firſt place in ſpeaking, as excelling (the reſt) as they doe which preſcribe a forme (of ſpeaking) vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: but he expounded his fayth, of whiche there was ſprong ſiniſter reports: and they (I meane the Apoſtles) allowed the ſame with their aſſent.</p>

Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the maner of this fellowſhip was ſuch, that they parted the Prouinces or charge among them. therefore they were equall, therefore Paule was no whit vnder them.

He doth alwayes vrge this, that he was made an Apoſtle by the gifte and ordinaunce of God: but hee adioyneth here in this place, that hee was of the Apoſtles acknowledged to bee ſuche an one. and thereof it followeth that thoſe Varlets didde indeuoure that whiche the Apoſtles durſte not, leaſt they ſhould reſiſt the election of God. And here he beginneth to challenge vnto himſelfe, that whiche was proper and peculier vnto him before (all) others: that is to ſaye the Apoſtleſhip of vncircumciſion. for in this poynte did Paule and Barnabas differ from the reſidue, for that they two were appoynted Apoſtles to the Gentils. That was brought to paſſe by the Oracle of God: the which to be ratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Apoſtles not onely ſuffered it, but alſo willed it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was vngodly not to obay (it).

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7611:23"/> them: that is, that Paule and Barnabas ſhoulde bee the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of the Gentils, and the other ſhoulde be the Apoſtles of the Iewes. <label type="milestone">

For it is manifeſt that the Apoſtles neuer trauayled the (whole) Worlde. naye rather it is credible that none of the xii. euer paſſed ouer into Europe: for that whiche they affyrme of Peter, I cannot tell whether it be a tale or not: but truelye it is very vncertayne. If any man will make exception and ſaye, notwithſtanding this, euery one of their miniſteries is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, as well to the Gentils as to the Iewes: I graunte it, as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall ſerue. I graunt, I ſay, that euery Apoſtle had the office of ſpreading abroade the Goſpell, as well among the Gentils, as the Iewes: neyther had they ſo parted it among themſelues that they had limits or boundes ſet betweene, beyonde whiche it was not lawfull to paſſe: as kingdomes, principallities, and Capitaynſhips are accuſtomed to be bounded. For we ſee howe Paule, whereſoeuer he came, accounted it ordinary firſt of all to offer his labour and miniſterie to the Iewes. as it was lawfull for him among the Gentils to exhibite and ſhewe himſelfe an Apoſtle and teacher vnto the Iewes: ſo was it free vnto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to bring vnto Chriſte whomeſoeuer they coulde of the Gentils, the whiche authoritie Peter vſed towarde Cornelius and others, <hi>Act. 10.1.</hi> But becauſe the other Apoſtles were in that Countrey whoſe inhabitauntes were almoſte all Iewes: Paule went about <hi>Aſia, Graecia,</hi> and other farre Countreyes: by this occaſion he was peculiarly ordayned the Apoſtle of the Gentils. Yea rather when as the Lorde in the beginning com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded him to be ſette aparte, his will was that hee ſhoulde leaue Antiochia, and Syria, and go ouer the ſea into far coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes for the Gentils ſake. Therefore his ordinary Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was ouer the Gentils, and his extraordinary Apoſtleſhip ouer the Iewes. Contrarywiſe, the other tooke vnto them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the (charge of the) Iewes: but vnder this condition, that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7611:23"/> vnto the Gentils, when occaſion was offered, their miniſterie ſhould not be ſhut vp. but this later, was as it were, extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narye vnto them. But if the Apoſtleſhip of Peter did peculyer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong vnto the Iewes, let the Romaniſtes conſider by what right they drawe or deriue the ſucceſſion of the Primacie from him vnto them. For if the Pope of Rome doe therefore chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge vnto himſelfe the ſupremacie becauſe he is the ſucceſſour of Peter: he muſt exerciſe the ſame ouer the Iewes. In this place Paule is declared to be the cheefe Apoſtle of the Gentils, whome they denye to haue bene the Romane Biſhop. therefore, that he may enioy ſome poſſeſſion of his Supremacie, hee muſt get him churches among the Iewes. for it becommeth vs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him (our) Apoſtle, which both by the determination or appoyntment of the holye Ghoſt, and by the conſente of the whole Colledge of the Apoſtles, is expreſly named vnto vs. Hee that doth paſſe ouer this right to Peter, doth confound the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce both of God and man.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7611:24"/> not that which the Apoſtles in the beginning did manifeſtly ſee. Here are we admoniſhed, to giue place to the grace of God, whereſoeuer it is ſeene, except we meane to warre agaynſt the holy Ghoſt him ſelfe, who will not haue his gyftes to be ydle and fruitleſſe. Therefore the grace which the Apoſtles did ſee to be giuen to Paul and Barnabas, did prouoke and moue them to eſtabliſh their felowſhip in the miniſtery. <hi>Iames &amp; Cephas.</hi> I haue afore ſhewed that this Iames was the ſonne of Alphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us: neither could he be the brother of Iohn, which Herode had a litle afore ſlaine, and that he ſhould be one of the diſciples, which ſhould ſo much excell the Apoſtles, in my iudgement, is very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely. And that he (I meane Iames) was a principall among the Apoſtles, Luke alſo doth ſhew, who doth attribute vnto him the concluſion and the defining of the cauſe in the Councell. Act. <hi>15.13.</hi> and <hi>21.18.</hi> he ſheweth that all the Seniors of the Church of Ieruſalem were gathered together vnto him. That they <hi>ſeemed to be pillers,</hi> he ſpeaketh not it in contempt, but he alleageth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon opinion: becauſe thereof it followeth, that that which they did, might not be refuſed or reiected raſhly or lightly. Seeing that the queſtion is here touching dignitie it is maruell that Iames is preferred before Peter. it may happe that it was becauſe he was ruler or biſhop of the Church of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem. As touching the name Piller, we know that the nature of things doth ſo beare or ſuffer, that they which excell in wit, in wiſedome, or in other giftes, are alſo ſuperiors in authoritye. In the Church of God the matter ſtandeth thus, that as euery one excelleth in greater grace, ſo the more honour ſhoulde bee giuen vnto him. For it is vnthankfulneſſe, naye rather impiety, not to worſhip the ſpirite of God, whereſoeuer he appeareth in his giftes.

For Peter woulde not haue bene afrayde to offende Iames or thoſe whiche were ſent from him:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7611:25"/> ſeeing that that determination proceeded from his iudgement. but nowe Paule is caried further, for that he auoucheth his goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell agaynſt the ſimulation of Peter. In the beginning he ſaid, that the certentie of his Goſpell did not hang vppon Peter and the Apoſtles, that by their arbitrement it ſhould ſtande or fall. Secondarily, he ſayde that it was approued of all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any exception or gayneſaying: ſpecially of them which by all mens conſentes were the principall. Now (as I haue ſayd) he goeth farther, ſhewing that Peter was reprehended by him, becauſe he enclined to the contrary part: by which occaſion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, he entreth in to the handling of the cauſe it ſelfe. And hereof it appeareth howe ſounde his doctrine is, of which he hath not onely obteined a voluntary ſubſcription or conſent: but alſo howe conſtauntly he hath auouched it agaynſt Peter, and howe in the controuerſie he was ſuperiour. What more doubt dothe there then remayne, that it ſhould not be receiued for a certaine and an inuincible trueth? That ſlaunder alſo is beaten downe, That Paule was a common diſciple farre diſtaunt from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Apoſtleſhip. For this reprehenſion is a ſigne of equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. I graunt that the higheſt are reprehended of the loweſt, and that by right. and ſo it followeth not that they which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue any man, be ſtraightways equals vnto them. For this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie is of God permitted the inferiours toward their betters. but the qualitie of the reprehenſion is in this place to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. For Paule did not ſimply reprehende Peter as one Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doth another: but he did it as they ſay <hi>Ex officio,</hi> that is to ſay, according to the right or prerogatiue of the Apoſtolike perſon which he executed. And here the Papacie of Rome is throwne flat downe with an other thunderbolt: ſpeciallye that ſhameleſneſſe or impudencie is conuinced and manifeſtly ſhewed in that the Romane Antichriſt doth boaſt himſelfe free from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing an account, and in that he doeth exempt himſelfe from the iudgement of the whole Church. In this place one man, not raſhly, not with an vnlawfull boldnes, but according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power and authoritie graunted him of God, doth rebuke Peter before the whole Church: and Peter doth ſubmit himſelfe obediently to the rebuke. nay rather the whole diſputation of theſe two Chapters, was nothing elſe then a manifeſt ouerthrowing of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7611:25"/> that tyrannicall ſupremacie, which the Romaniſts do babble to haue bene founded by the law of God. But if they will haue god to be the authour thereof, they muſt needes then forge a newe ſcripture. And if they will not haue him to their profeſſed eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: of neceſſitie they muſt wipe out theſe two chapters out of the holy ſcripture. <hi>Becauſe he was worthy of reprehenſion.)</hi> The greeke Participle ſignifieth <hi>reprehenſus,</hi> that is, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, but I am out of doubte that it is put in ſteede of the Nowne, for him that deſerueth a iuſte reprehenſion. for whereas Chryſoſtom doth enterprete it thus, That that complainte and the accuſation did ariſe of others, truly it is a cold or weake ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. For it is often vſed of the Greekes, to giue vnto par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiples the ſignification of nownes, the which euery man ſeeth to agree to this place. and hereof a man maye readilye gather, how vnapt the expoſition of Hierome and Chriſoſtome is, who thought the Apoſtles of a ſet matche to haue played this part or pranke before the people. Neither doe theſe two wordes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> helpe them, which ſignifie that Peter being repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended to his face had neuer a word to aunſwere. Whereas Chriſoſtome doth iudge, that they, to auoyd offence, would haue talked together priuately, if they had had any diſſention, it is of no waight: for other ſmall offences were little to bee regarded in reſpect of this moſt pernicious offence, becauſe the Churche (by this) ſhould be deuyded, becauſe (by this) the Chriſtian ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie was in hazarde, becauſe (by this) the grace of Chriſt was ouerwhelmed. openly therfore muſt this open or publique ſinne be reprehended. The cheefeſt argument or reaſon whereto Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome leaneth, is to be friuolous and vayne. Why would Paule haue condemned [ſayth he] in an other, that which he counteth prayſe worthy in himſelfe? for he boaſteth that to the Iewes he was become a Iewe, <hi>1.</hi> Cor. <hi>9.20.</hi> I aunſwere, That Peter did farre otherwiſe. for Paule didde not in any wiſe conforme himſelfe to the Iewes, but that the doctrine of libertie ſhoulde remayne ſafe and ſound. whereby neither would he circumciſe Titus, that the truth of the Goſpell might remayn whole. But Peter did ſo play the Iewe, that he draue the Gentils into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and ſeruitude: and alſo as it were with this preiudice he did abaſe the doctrine of Paule. He did not therefore holde the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7611:26"/> meane: becauſe he had more regarde to gratifie, than to edifie, and he did more reſpect what pleaſed the Iewes, then what was expedient for the whole body. More rightly therefore hath Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine iudged, whiche ſayth that nothing was done of a ſette matehe; but that Paule did ſincerelye of a Chriſtian zeale ſette himſelfe againſte the naughtye and vnſeaſonable ſimulation of Peter: becauſe he deemed it harmefull to the Church.</p>

                  <hi>12 For before certaine came.)</hi> The ſtate of the cauſe is here deſcribed, that Peter for the Iewes ſake had made a departing from the Gentils: ſo that he would driue them from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, except they would renounce the liberty of the Goſpell, and put their necks vnder the yoke of the law. If Paul ſhould now haue held his peace, his whole doctrine did fall, his whole building erected through his miniſterie did lie aground. therefore it was neede for him both ſtoutly to reſiſt, and ſharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fight. Here we beholde how warily we muſt attemper our ſelues to pleaſe men: leſt we ſwerue aſide from the right courſe, with too much deſire to pleaſe, or elſe with prepoſterous feare to offend. If that might happen to Peter, howe much more eaſilye ſhall it happen to vs, except we take very good heede?</p>

The right path or way to the truth of the Goſpel, keeping ſound the true Doctrine, was to vnite and bring in one the Iewes and the Gentils. but to bynde the conſciences of the Godlye with the neceſſitye of keeping the lawe, and in ſilence to burye the Doctrine of libertie: were an vnworthye rewarde of vnitie. <hi>The truth of the Goſpell.</hi> Paule taketh in this place as afore hee didde: vnto which he ſetteth oppoſite the colour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Peter and other did deforme the Goſpell: Whiche ſith it is ſo, it is not to bee doubted that Paules contention was ſerious and waightye. As touching doctrine they did verye well agree: but becauſe Peter hauing no reſpecte of Doctrine did too too ſeruilely followe the Iewes mynde, therefore is he reproued of halting. There be ſome which with another pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence may excuſe Peter: for that hee being the Apoſtle of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7611:26"/> Circumciſion, ought to haue had more care of the Iewes ſaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde or ſaluation: and neuertheleſſe they maye alſo graunte, that Paule did well in taking vpon him the Gentils cauſe. but it is a fonde thing to defende that whiche the holye Ghoſt hath condemned by the mouth of Paule. Neyther was mans buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe talked of here, but the puritie of the Goſpell was brought into daunger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leaſt it ſhoulde be defiled with Iudaicall leauen. <hi>Before all.</hi> By this example we are admoniſhed, that they are openly to be chaſtiſed, which to the hurt of many haue offended: as farre forth as it is profitable for the Churche. The ende is, leſt if ſuche a fault ſhoulde be lefte vnpuniſhed, it ſhoulde by the example thereof doe harme. and Paule doth teach <hi>1.</hi> Tim. <hi>5.</hi> ver. <hi>20.</hi> that that oughte to bee obſerued namely in Prieſts or Elders, that is to ſaye for that, in reſpecte of the office whiche they beare, they doe by their example more greeuouſlye hurte. but ſpeciallye it was profitable to defende conſtantlye before the people a good cauſe whiche did belong to all, whereby Paule might make it more manifeſt that he did not flye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> light.</p>

But Paule by preuenting dothe wiſely wreſte it to the contrarye. for ſeing that the Iewes themſelues with all their dignitie were conſtrained to flie to the faithe of Chriſt: howe muche more behoued it the Gentils to get ſaluation by faith? The mind of Paule than is thus, We which ſeme to excell other, which haue bine through the benifite of his couenaunt alwayes nighe God; haue neuer the later founde no reaſon or meane to get ſaluation, but vy beleuing in Chriſt; why than ſhould we preſcribe any other meane vnto the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils? For if the Lawe were neceſſarie, or els could preuaile the folowers thereof vnto ſaluation: it would moſte of all haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed vs, vnto whome it was giuen. and if ſo be that we haue left it and are gone vnto Chriſt, much leſſe are the gentils to be vrged to take it vppon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The word <hi>Sinner</hi> doth ſignifie here, as it doth often in other places, vnholye or loſt and eſtraunged from God. ſuch were the Gentils, who had no fellowſhip with God: but the Iewes were by adoption the Children of God, and therefore ſegregate or ſet apart into holyneſſe. Whereas he ſayth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>by nature,</hi> hee doth not meane that they are by nature free from the corruption of mankinde: for Dauid who diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by lineage from Abraham, confeſſeth that he was begotte

And becauſe the promiſe made the bleſſing an inheritaunce, therefore it is called a good thing, naturall or by nature. So to the Romaynes, Chap. <hi>11.</hi> ver. <hi>16.</hi> he ſayth they were ſprong oute of an holy roote. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when hee ſayth, <hi>We are by nature Iewes,</hi> is as muche as if he ſhoulde ſaye, Wee are borne holye not by our owne deſart, but becauſe we are choſen of God to be his people. We than which by nature were Iewes, what haue we done? wee haue beleeued in Chriſt. To what ende haue wee beleeued? that by the fayth of Chriſte we mighte be iuſtifyed. For what cauſe? Becauſe we were conuinced and put oute of doubte that men could not obtayne righteouſneſſe by the workes of the Lawe. Hee than reaſoneth after the nature and effecte of faith, that the Iewes are not iuſtified by the Lawe. For as they who would eſtabliſh their owne righteouſneſſe of workes are not ſubiecte to the righteouſneſſe of GOD, Rom. <hi>10.3.</hi> ſo on the contrary part they whiche beleeue in Chriſte, doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe themſelues to be ſinners, and renounce the righteouſneſſe of workes. Hee is buſied here in the chiefeſt queſtyon: naye rather in the whole ſumme almoſt of the controuerſie, is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this propoſition: wherefore it is meete the more dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to ſtande vpon the diſcuſſing of this preſent place. Firſte and formoſt this is to be noted, that righteouſneſſe muſt bee ſought by the fayth of Chriſt, becauſe we cannot bee iuſtified by workes. Now it is demaunded what hee meaneth by <hi>Workes of the Law.</hi> The Papiſtes being beguiled by Origen and Hierome doe ſuppoſe that the controuerſie is of ſhadowes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye: nay rather they doe firmely define ſo. and therefore they doe alwaye by the <hi>Workes of the Law</hi> interprete ceremonies: as though Paule didde not diſpute of the free righteouſneſſe which is giuen vnto vs by Chriſt. neyther doe they holde it to be an abſurditie that no man is iuſtified by the workes of the Law:<note place="margin">Without rime or reaſon.</note> and yet (they holde) that wee are accounted righteous before GOD through the merite of workes.

                  </label> This was the onely occation of the error of Origen and Hierom: for they thought it conuenient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Paule, ſeing the falſe Apoſtles contended about ceremonies onely, ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend or take hold of no more (than they ſpake of). But they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered not that this was the very cauſe why he did ſo ſharply contend (with them), for that that doctrine did drawe a longer traine, than at the firſt ſight it did ſhewe. for it woulde not haue bene ſo greeuous to Paule to haue had ceremonies obſerued, as to haue the confidence and glory of ſaluation aſcribed vnto works. as whan we contend about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forbidding of eating fleſhe except vpon certen dayes, we do not reſpect ſo much howe great a matter it is to forbid the eating of fleſhe, as wee are carefull concerning the ſnare of the conſcience. Therefore Paule doth not ſtray beſide the cauſe or matter, when as he fra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7611:28"/> his diſputation of the whole Lawe: although the falſe Apoſtles did onely contende about Ceremonies, for therefore did they vrge Ceremonyes, that men ſhould ſeeke ſaluation in the keeping of the Law: becauſe, forſooth, they fayned it to bee a meritorious worſhipping or ſeruice. wherefore Paule doeth not lay againſt them the Lawe morall, but the onelye grace of Chriſt. Neyther is the whole Epiſtle ſpente in this vniuerſall contention, for he commeth at length to Ceremonies by name. but becauſe this was a principall Knot and Doubte, Whether righteouſneſſe happened vnto vs by Fayth or by workes, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooued that it ſhould firſt be diſpatched. The Papiſtes at theſe dayes, becauſe it greeueth them, if we wring out of them that men are iuſtified by fayth only, do hardly graunt morall things to be comprehended vnder the workes of the Law. yea many of them obiecting the gloſe of Hierome thinke they haue handled the matter very handſomly: but the texte will euidently ſhewe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſpeaketh of the morall law alſo. <hi>But by the faith.)</hi> He doth not meane ceremonies only or any maner workes not to ſuffice, except the helpe of fayth be ioyned: but vnto the negatiue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition he doth counterſet the excluſiue: as if he ſhould ſay, Not by workes, but by the onely fayth of Chriſt. Otherwiſe it were an vnapt ſentence, &amp; cleane came from his purpoſe. for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> falſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did not refuſe chriſt, nor yet faith: but they required that ceremonyes ſhould be ioyned with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If Paul would haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſuch a maner of ioining, there had bene a full agreement betweene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. and than Paule had in vain troubled the Church with ſo hateful a contention. Let this than remain determined: that in this place there is an excluſiue propoſition, That we are not iuſtified otherwiſe than by faith: or, That we are not iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied but by faith, vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which, this is equiualent, We are iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith only.

Paule was ignoraunt of ſuch halfe iuſtifying. for whan hee teacheth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we are righteous through faith, becauſe wee cannot be ſo by works: he taketh it as a thing graunted which is (alſo) true y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we are capable of Chriſts righteouſneſſe no otherwiſe,

That that oughte not to bee imputed to Chriſte, whiche properlye is the worke of the Lawe. for there is no neede of Chriſte to make voyde the righteouſneſſe of the Law: becauſe the Lawe it ſelfe doeth kill the Diſciples thereof: as though hee ſhoulde ſaye, You deceaue poore miſerable men with a falſe imagination, as though they ſhoulde liue by the lawe, and by that pretence you detayne them in the Lawe: in the meane while you make the Goſpell to bee ſpyted, as though it broughte to noughte the righteouſneſſe whiche wee haue by the Lawe. but it is the Lawe it ſelfe whiche compelleth vs to die to it. for wheras it threatneth deſtruction vnto vs and leueth nothing vnto vs but deſpaire, by that means it driueth vs from truſting to it. A more eaſie vnderſtanding of this place is to be ſought out of the ſeuenth chapter to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, for there Paule doth plainely deſcribe, that no man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to the lawe, but he vnto whome the lawe is dead, that is to ſay, idle and without working. or for as ſoone as the law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to liue in vs, it ſtriketh vs with a deadly wound wherby we periſhe: and with all it inſpireth life, ſinne being firſt dead. They therefore which liue vnto the Lawe, haue neuer felte the ſtrength of the Lawe, no nor yet haue once taſted what the lawe meaneth: for the law being truly vnderſtanded, doth compell vs to dye to it, and hereof is ſinne, and not of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7611:30"/> Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To die to the Law,</hi> is eyther to renounce it and to be ſette at freedome from the power and dominyon thereof, ſo that wee haue no confidence in it, nor agayne that it holde vs Captyues vnder the yoke of bondage: or elſe thus, for that it alotteth vs all to deſtruction, wee can fynde no lyfe in it. and this latter ſence is more conuenient. For hee denyeth Chriſte to bee the authour of this euill, becauſe the Lawe is more hurtfull then profitable: but (hee affyrmeth) that there is included in the Lawe it ſelfe, the curſe which kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs. Whereof it followeth, that that ſtroke or wounde whiche is ſtriken by the Lawe, is in deede deadlye: agaynſte this is ſette another kynde of death being liuely, in the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the croſſe of Chriſt. And therefore hee ſayeth that hee is crucified together with Chriſte, that hee mighte beginne to lyue. That diſtinction that commonlye hath preuayled doth darken the naturall ſence and meaning: if they reade <hi>I by the Lawe am deade to the Lawe that I mighte liue to Chriſte.</hi> but the contrarye Texte ſoundeth better (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye) <hi>I by the Lawe am deade to the Lawe:</hi> and than by it ſelfe, <hi>that I mighte liue to Chriſte I am crucified vyith Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>That I might liue to God)</hi> Hee ſheweth that kynde of death to bee worthye the wiſhing, whereof the falſe Apoſtles tooke occaſion of ſpighte. for hee declareth that wee doe not therefore dye to the Lawe that wee ſhoulde lyue to ſinne, but to GOD. To liue to GOD ſometyme is (ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) to frame our lyfe after his will: ſo that wee ſtudye nothing elſe all our life long, but to be accepted of him. but in this place, it is to liue the life of GOD (if I maye ſo ſaye) whereby the thinges oppoſite maye aunſwere the one the other. for by that reaſon that it is ſayde wee dye vnto the Lawe, by the ſame it is ſayde that wee liue vnto GOD. In ſumme, Paule doeth admoniſhe vs that that death is not mortall, but rather a cauſe of a better life: for God taketh vs oute of the Shipwracke of the Lawe, and by his grace reſtoreth vs to a better life. I lette paſſe other expoſitions, me thinkes this is the naturall meaning of Paule. Whereas
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7611:31"/> he ſayth <hi>he is crucified with Chriſt,</hi> he expreſſeth the meane how we being dead vnto the Law liue vnto God: when as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth we being grafted into the death of Chriſt, doe drawe an hidden power from thence, as a grafte doth from the roote. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore Chriſt hath faſtened to his croſſe the handwriting of the Law which was againſte vs. therefore we being crucified with Chriſt are deliuered from all the curſes of the Lawe and guiltineſſe, he that goeth about to make this deliuerance vaine, doth make voyde the croſſe of Chriſt. But let vs make account that we are not otherwiſe loſed from the yoke of the Lawe, than while we are made one with Chriſt, euen as the grafte doth not otherwiſe draw moyſture from the roote, except it grow togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into one nature (with it).</p>

And alſo he doth declare, what he meante before (by theſe wordes) <hi>to liue to God:</hi> that forſooth nowe hee liueth not by his owne life, but that he is ſo liued with the hidden vertue &amp; power of Chriſt, that Chriſt may he ſayde to liue and to flouriſh in him. For as the ſoule nouriſheth the body (with life): ſo alſo doth Chriſt inſpire life into his membres. A notable ſentence. That the faythfull liue without themſelues, that is to ſaye in Chriſt. which cannot be but they muſt haue a true and a ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The other is, that hee maketh vs pertakers of his righteouſneſſe: that when wee bee not able in our ſelues, (yet) in him we maye be acceptable vnto God. The firſt belongeth to regeneration or new byrth: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde belongeth to the free accepting of righteouſneſſe, of the which we may vnderſtande this place (to meane): although, if any man had rather vnderſtand it of both, I willingly will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it. <hi>In as much as I now liue in the fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

For this is the rewarde of (his) death, that by purging of our ſinnes, he hath reconciled vs vnto his Father. hereof it followeth that by his grace we are iuſtified, and therfore not by workes. The Papiſts interprete it of the ceremoniall Lawe, but who ſeeth not that it hath reſpecte to the whole Lawe? for it is as muche as Paule ſhoulde ſaye, If wee our ſelues deſerue righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, than Chriſte hath ſuffered in vayne. for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuffered hee that hee mighte obtayne righteouſneſſe for vs. and what needeth that to be gotten vs of another, that wee canne giue to oure owne ſelues?

Some thinke that Paule had reſpecte to the diſpoſition of the nation, for they hauing their originall of Barbarians, were to be handled the more hardlye: but I hadde rather referre it ſimply to the the thing it ſelfe. for it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous thing, that in ſo great cleareneſſe of the Goſpell, there

Hee ſayeth therefore that the perſpicuitie or playneſſe of his Doctrine hath bene ſo great that it hath not bene ſo muche a bare teaching, as a liuelye and expreſſe Image of Chriſte. their knowledge then was ſuche as might be compared to a ſeeing. The expoſition of Auguſtine is harde, and farre from the mynde of Paule, who ſayth that Chriſte was ſette forth as though hee ſhoulde bee put out of poſſeſſion, Some reade for <hi>Proeſcriptus,</hi>

Let vs therefore keepe this ſence that they
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7611:34"/> were no otherwiſe inſtructed of Chriſt by the doctrine of Paul, than if he had bene ſhewed them in a table, nay rather crucified among them. Such a repreſentation can bee done with no elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, with no colours of Rethoricians, excepte that efficacie of the Spirite, of whiche hath bene ſpoken in both Epiſtles to the Corinthes, be preſent. Therefore they whiche will duelye doe their Office in the Miniſterie of the Goſpell, lette them learne, not onely to ſpeake and preache ofte, but alſo to pierce into the conſciences, that Chriſt crucified may be perceyued and felt, and his blood may diſtill or drop into them.

Fyrſte brieflye is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanded what Fayth in this place meaneth with Paule: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, what righteouſneſſe: thyrdlye, why fayth is deemed the cauſe of iuſtification. Fayth is not taken for euerye perſwaſion which men may haue of the truth of God. for be it that Caine had a hundred tymes beleeued God when he tolde him he would puniſhe him, he hadde not bene the nere to obtayne righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Abraham therefore was iuſtified by beleeuing, becauſe whereas he had of God a promiſe of his fatherly goodneſſe, he did certaynely and ſurely embrace the ſame. than Fayth in this place hath a relation and reſpecte vnto ſuche a worde of GOD, as men hauing it (in poſſeſſion) may reſt in it, and ſticke faſt to it. As touching the worde Righteouſneſſe, the manner of ſpeaking of Moſes is to be marked. for whereas he ſayth, It was imputed to Abraham for righteouſneſſe, becauſe he beleeued, hee declareth thereby that he is righteous that is ſo taken with GOD. And whereas men haue not righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe layde vp in themſelues, they obtayne the ſame by imputation. becauſe GOD doth impute Fayth vnto them, for righteouſneſſe. Wee are ſayde than to bee iuſtifyed by
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7611:36"/> Faith, not becauſe fayth doth poure into vs an habite or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie: but becauſe we are accepted before GOD. And why is there ſo great honour attributed to faith, that it is called the cauſe of our righteouſneſſe? Firſte wee muſt knowe, that it is the inſtrumentall cauſe onely: for, to ſpeake properly, our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe is nothing elſe, but a free accepting of GOD, in which lieth the foundation of our ſaluation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but becauſe the Lorde, in giuing vnto vs a Teſtimonie of his loue and grace thorowe the Goſpell, doeth communicate vnto vs that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe which I haue ſpoken off: therefore we take holde of it by fayth. Therefore when we attribute mans iuſtification vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fayth, wee diſpute not of the principall cauſe: but we note onelye the manner whereby men come to true righteouſneſſe. For this righteouſneſſe is the meere gifte of God, and not a qualitye whiche ſticketh or is in man: but is poſſeſſed onely by Fayth, neyther yet that by the deſerte or merite of Fayth, that it ſhould be as a due rewarde: but becauſe we receaue by Fayth, that which GOD of his owne accorde and good will doth giue. therefore all theſe ſpeeches are of like force, That we are iuſtified by the grace of God, That Chriſte is our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, That the mercye of GOD is the cauſe of our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, That righteouſneſſe is gotten vnto vs by the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, That righteouſneſſe is giuen vnto vs by the Goſpell, That we obtayne righteouſneſſe by Fayth. Whereby it appeareth howe childiſhlye they erre, whiche woulde make theſe propoſitions agree together, Wee are iuſtified by Fayth and Workes both: for hee that is iuſt by Fayth, he being bare and voyde of his owne righteouſneſſe, reſteth in the onlye grace of GOD. And this is the reaſon why Paule to the Romaynes doth conclude. that Abraham is deſtytute of Glorye before GOD, becauſe hee hath obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned righteouſneſſe by Fayth, Rom. <hi>4.2.</hi> for it is not ſayde that Fayth was imputed vnto him for parte of righteouſneſſe, but for righteouſneſſe ſimplye without more wordes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore Fayth was vnto him in the whole for righteouſneſſe. Fynal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye Fayth beholdeth nothing beſide the mercye of GOD and Chriſt deade and rayſed agayne. Therefore all merite of workes is ſhutte out from the cauſe of iuſtification, when as
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7611:37"/> all is aſſigned to fayth. For fayth, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it contayneth in it ſelfe the free goodneſſe of God, Chriſt with all his good things, the teſtimony (and witneſſe) of our adoption whiche is giuen in the Goſpell: is vtterly oppoſite and ſet againſt the law, the merits of workes, and the worthineſſe of men. for whereas the Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters doe thinke that it is only ſet agaynſt ceremonies, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the diſputation or reaſoning ſhall by and by with ſmall adoe thorowly reproue them. We muſt therefore beare in mind that they that are iuſt by fayth, are iuſt without themſelues, that is, in Chriſt. whereby alſo the fooliſhe cauillation of ſome, which dally with Paule, is confuted: becauſe (ſay they) Moſes calleth righteouſneſſe goodneſſe or honeſty: and ſo it ſignifieth nothing elſe, but Abraham was accounted a good man becauſe he beleeued God. Such frantike ſprites doth Sathan at theſe dayes rayſe vp, to ouerthrow the certayntie of the Scripture with crooked ſlaunders as it were with mynes, But Paule, who knew that Moſes in that place taught not children gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, but that he ſpake of the iudgement of God: did not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe take the worde Righteouſneſſe after the maner of a Diuine. for we are not deemed righteous before GOD, after the like reaſon wherewith we haue prayſe of goodneſſe before men: but when we bring perfecte obedience of the Lawe.

For euen in this doe the Children of God differ from the vnbeleeuers, for that they in deede haue the vſe of God his benefites together with the children of God, but yet like beaſtes they regarde not that which is higher, but as for God his Children, becauſe they know all benefites to be ſanctified by the promiſes of God, they acknowledge him in them to be a father. So it commeth to paſſe that they bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes directed to the hope of eternall life, becauſe they begin from the foundation, that is, from the faith of their adoption.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7611:41"/> not a firme defence to confute their ſlaunder. for euen in the ſonnes of Abraham there began ſuch a diuiſion that the one of them was cut off out of the family. In Iſaac ſhall thy ſeede bee called. Gen. <hi>21.12.</hi> therefore Iſmaell is not counted of. Let vs come vnto the ſeconde degree will the Iewes graunte that the poſteritie of Eſau is the bleſſed ſeede? naye they will contende that their father (I meane Eſau) was wiped out: although hee was the firſt begotten. and how many peoples came oute of the ſtocke of Abraham, which obtayne no place in this calling? At length twelue Patriarkes, were ſo many heads or principals: not becauſe they diſcended of the lineage of Abraham, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ordayned by the ſpeciall election of God. for ſince the tyme that the tenne trybes were led awaye Captyue, how many thouſandes haue ſo gone out of kynde, that they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne no name in the ſeede of Abraham? Laſtly the tribe of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da alſo was in daunger: that the true ſucceſſion of the bleſſing ſhoulde not remayne in a ſmall people. And ſo it was ſhewed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Eſa. <hi>10.21.</hi> The reſidue only ſhall be ſaued. Hitherto I haue ſpoken nothing which the Iewes graunte not. Let them therefore aunſwere mee, howe it happeneth that the thirteene Tribes, ſprong of the twelue Patriarches, haue bene the ſeede of Abraham rather than the Iſmaelites or Idumeans? why do they alone now boaſt of this name, and reiect other as an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous ſeede? They will boaſt that they obtayned it by their owne deſarte: but the ſcripture on the contrary ſide crieth oute (agaynſte them) that it dependeth all on God his calling, for alwayes muſt there be recourſe to that prerogatiue, In Iſaac ſhall thy ſeede be called. The continuall force of this preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue ought to be of force euen vntill Chriſt. for the Lorde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed the promiſe made to Abraham, afterwarde in Dauid, as in a long time after. Paule therefore doth not ſtande vppon the ſingular number, to prooue that this was ſpoken of one man: but onelye to ſhewe that this worde Seede reſteth vppon one, which is not onely borne of Abraham according to the fleſh: but alſo ordeyned herevnto by the calling of God. and if the Iewes denye this, they do nothing elſe by their ſtubborneſſe but make themſelues laughing ſtockes. But becauſe Paule gathereth out of thoſe ſame wordes alſo, that the couenaunt was begunne
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7611:42"/> in Chriſt, or towarde Chriſt: let vs diſcourſe what this maner of ſpeaking meaneth, In they ſeede ſhall all Nations be bleſſed. The Iewes cauill ſaying it is a compariſon: <label type="milestone">

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7611:42"/> (throughly) to the vttermoſte. For were it not for the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie aboute obtayning of righteouſneſſe, aboute merite of workes: and ſnaring of the conſciences: ceremonies would wel ſtande with the promiſe.

Agayn I repeate it, Except you vnderſtand the promiſe to be freely giuen, the ſentence is more than needes. for the law and the promiſe diſagree not, ſauing in the cauſe of iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. becauſe the lawe maketh a man righteous by the deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of workes, and the promiſe giueth righteouſneſſe freelye. and he doth playnelye expounde hymſelfe, when he nameth the couenaunt to haue his foundation in Chriſte. <label type="milestone">

I affirme nothing which the ſchole Diuines graunt not. for they teach that works merite not ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation by an inward worthineſſe, but by the acceptation of God (as they ſpeake it) &amp; by reaſon of the couenant.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7611:43" rendition="simple:additions"/> in the hand of Moſes. the former was founded in Chriſt: and therefore free. therefore the law ſtepping in could not bring to paſſe that men could haue ſaluation without grace: becauſe by this meanes the promiſe ſhould be made of none effect.

Fyrſte than hee requireth what the vſe of the Lawe is. for in as muche as it followed the promiſe, it ſeemeth that it oughte to ſupplye that which was wanting in it: and certaynely it was doubted hereof, whether that the promiſe by it ſelfe were of none effecte excepte it were holpen of the Lawe.

But Paule would not haue the couenaunt of God ſo to be eſteemed, as though it were contrary to it ſelf, or chaungeable, according to the diuerſitie of men.

And this is brought to paſſe while Chriſt, bringing them to one God which afore were at variaunce betweene themſelues, doth make them to growe together into one body.

For if there be one Churche of the Iewes and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils, why is the gouernment diuerſe or contrary? from whence or by what right is this newe libertie, ſeing that the Fathers had bene vnder the ſubiection of the lawe? therefore doeth hee teache ſuche a difference to be, which might not hinder the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and concorde of the Church. The readers are agayne to bee admoniſhed, that Paule ſpeaketh not of ceremonies onlye, nor yet of the law morall apart by it ſelfe: but he comprehendeth al the gouernment, wherewith the Lord gouerned his people vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the olde Teſtament. For about this grew the controuerſie, Whether the forme of gouernment inſtituted by Moſes did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle to the obtayning of righteouſneſſe. This Law doth Paul compare firſt of all to a priſon or warde, after that to a Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayſter, and with both ſimilitudes doth he make it apparaunt, that the nature of the law was ſuch, that it oughte not to bee of force but for a certayne tyme. <hi>Fayth.</hi> He ſignifieth the full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealing of thoſe thinges which than lay hidden, vnder the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcureneſſe of the ſhadowes of the law. for he taketh not awaye fayth from the fathers who liued vnder the Law. Wee haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeene of the fayth of Abraham. the Authour of the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes maketh mention of the enſamples of others in the eleuenth Chapter. to be ſhort, the doctrine of Fayth hath te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonye from Moſes and all the Prophets: but becauſe the cleareneſſe of fayth did not than ſo manifeſtly appeare, therefore he calleth the time of fayth the tyme of the new Teſtament, in way of compariſon and not flatly. And that this was his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he doth by and by ſhew, when he ſayth that they were ſhut vnder fayth, which was to be reuealed: for he teſtifieth by theſe wordes, that they were pertakers of the ſame fayth, who were ſhut vnder the worde of the Law. For the Law didde not keepe them back from fayth: but it did bridle them that they ſhoulde not wander out of the Limits of fayth. and it is an ellegant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion to that whiche he had ſette downe before, <hi>viz.</hi> That the

As therefore they were beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and helde in on euery ſide by the curſe: ſo had they a warde or defence agaynſt this ſiege, which mighte defende them from the curſe. wherefore he ſheweth that the ward of the Lawe was in ſpirite very free Faith at that time was not as yet reuealed: not becauſe the fathers were voyde of al light, but becauſe they had leſſe light than we, for whereas with them Chriſt was ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed by ceremonies, as being abſent: at theſe dayes hee is as it were ſet before vs euen to our face. ſo for the Glaſſe whiche they had to ſee him in, we at theſe dayes haue the ſubſtaunce or thing it ſelfe. Whatſoeuer therefore the obſcuritie of the Lawe was, yet the Fathers were not ignoraunte in what waye they ought to walke. for although the light aboute the dawning bee not ſo cleare as it is about noone: yet thoſe that are trauailers tarry not till the ſonne be full vp, becauſe it is ynough for them to holde on their iorney. ſo their portion of light was vnto them like the dauning, which might guide them ſafely from all perill of error to eternall bliſſe.</p>

But it is demaunded what maner of one, the doctrine or diſcipline of this Scholemaiſterſhip hath
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7611:48"/> bene. Firſt, the Law by making the righteouſneſſe of God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, did reprehend them for their owne vnrighteouſneſſe. for they might beholde in the commaundementes of God as it were in a glaſſe, how far off they were from true righteouſneſſe. and ſo they were put in mind, that righteouſneſſe was elſe where to be ſought, The like office had the promiſes of the law. For thus they oughte to thinke with themſelues, If thou canſte not obtayne life by thy workes otherwiſe then by fulfilling of the Lawe, another newe waye is to bee ſoughte, for thy weakeneſſe will neuer ſuffer thee to climbe vp thither: yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit thou art greatly deſirous and ſtriueſt, yet alwayes ſhalt thou be farre from [hitting] the marke. On the other ſide threatnings did vrge them and ſtir them to ſeeke to eſcape the wrath and curſe of GOD. naye rather they ſuffered them not to reſt till they had pricked them forth to aſke the grace of Chriſt. To that purpoſe tended all the ceremonyes. for to what ende were the ſacrifices and waſhinges, but that they mighte be excerciſed, in the continuall thinking on their filth and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?

Whatſoeuer in the whole pompe of ceremonies was ſet before their eyes, they had as it were a note or marke of Chriſte prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in it.

Therefore not without cauſe doth Paule whileſt he ſpeaketh to the faythful, ſay they haue put on Chriſt in Baptiſme. as, Rom. <hi>6.5.</hi> hee ſayeth wee are grafted into his death, that we might be partakers alſo of his reſurrection. By this meanes neyther is that which is proper vnto God paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto the ſigne, and yet the Sacraments haue their force, leaſt they mighte be accounted for vaine and fruiteleſſe gaſes. and we are admoniſhed how miſchieuous the vnthankfulneſſe of men is, whileſt they make the healthſome ordinaunces of God, by their abuſe not onelye vnprofitable vnto them, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo do turne them to their deſtruction.</p>

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7611:50"/> appoynted of his father, and after that he enioyeth his libertie. After this ſort the Fathers vnder the olde teſtament, when as they were the ſonnes of God, were free: but were not in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of freedome or libertie, becauſe the law was vnto them as it were a tutor, which helde them vnder the yoke. And this bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage laſted as long as it ſeemed good vnto God, who made an ende thereof by the comming of Chriſt. whereas Paule doeth make ende the Tutorſhip at the onelye appoyntmente of the Father, when as the Lawyers do recken vp more wayes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the tutorſhip is ended: he doth it therefore becauſe this waye alone did agree with his ſimilitude. Nowe let vs diſcourſe euery part. Some doe apply this ſimilitude otherwiſe: namely vnto euery man: whereas Paule ſpeaketh of two peoples. I graunt, it is true that which they ſaye, but it longeth nothing vnto the preſent place. The elect, ſay they, although they be the ſons of God euer from their mothers wombe, yet they abide vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law like vnto ſeruants, vntil through faith they come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poſſeſſion of libertie: but after that they know Chriſt, they made no more this kinde of Tutorſhip. But let me graunt this, yet denye I that Paule in this place ſpeaketh of euerye ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler perſon: and I denye that it putteth difference betweene the time of infidelitie &amp; of the calling vnto faith, but hereof hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth, wheras there is but one church of God, how hapneth it that the ſtate of vs and the Iſralites ſhould be vnlike and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie? wheras by faith we be free, howe happeneth it that they who had with vs the ſame and like faith, ſhall not with vs be enioyers of the ſame and like libertie? wheras a like we are all the ſonnes of God, how happeneth it that we are free at this daye from the yoke which they were compelled to beare? hereof did grow the controuerſie and contention: and not (of his), howe and in what manner the Lawe hath dominion ouer euery one of vs, before that by fayth wee are ſet at freedome from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage thereof. Let this therefore be determined aboue all, that Paule in this place doeth compare the Iſraeticall Churche, which was vnder the old teſtament, with the Chriſtian Church: that thereby it maye appeare wherein wee agree, and wherein the one of vs differ from the other. This compariſon conteineth a very plentifull doctrine, and the ſame very profitable. Firſte,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7611:51"/> hereof we gather, That the Fathers vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> olde teſtament had the ſame hope of inheritaunce, which we at this day haue: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were partakers of the ſame adoption. for Paule tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth not (as ſome braynſick fellowes, and among others Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetus, doe dreame) that they were for this purpoſe onely elected of God, that they ſhoulde figure vnto vs ſome certayne people of God, but that with vs they might be the ſonnes of God: and expreſly he doeth teſtifie, that the ſpirituall bleſſing promiſed to Abraham doeth no leſſe long vnto them than vnto vs. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly we gather, that their conſciences were free neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in that outwarde bondage. for the ſtraight tying to the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Law did not let Moſes, Daniell, all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly Kings, Prieſtes and Prophets, and all the company of the Faythfull, but that they were free in Spirite. They caried than the yoke of the Lawe on their ſhoulders, ſo that neuerthelater they might worſhip God with a free ſpirite: and cheefely that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtructed about the free forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, they mighte haue their conſcience free from the tyrannie of ſinne and death. Thereof wee muſt determine, that the doctrine hath bene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes one and the ſame, and that they were ioined with vs in a true vnitie of fayth: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue enioyed with vs the confidence of one Mediator, that they haue called vp God the Father, and that they were gouerned with the ſelfe ſame Spirite. To all theſe it is agreeable, that the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betweene vs and the olde Fathers, is not in ſubſtance but in accidents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for touching thoſe things that are principall in the Teſtament or couenaunt, in thoſe thinges we agree. the ceremonies, and all that gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which we differ, are as it were additions. Moreouer you muſt mark, that that time was the child age of the Church. but nowe ſithens Chriſts comming the Church is growne vp, ſo that it is after a ſorte in the man age thereof. The wordes of Paule are cleare. but hereof groweth ſome hardenes, becauſe he ſeemeth not to agree with himſelfe. For to the Ephe. <hi>4.13.</hi> he exhorteth vs to goe forwarde dayly, vntill we come to a full age and the meaſure of fulnes. And to the Corinthians the firſt epiſtle. cap. <hi>3.1.</hi> he mentioneth that he gaue them milk to drink, as vnto children: becauſe they could not brooke ſtrong meate. and a little after he will compare the Galathians vnto infants.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7611:51"/> I anſwere, that there he ſpeaketh of euery ſinguler perſon, and of the priuate fayth of euery man: but in this place he ſpeaketh of two bodies or companyes in a groſſe ſinne, hauing no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of the perſons. This aunſwere will ſerue to ſolue a much harder queſtion. For we ſee howe incomparable the fayth of Abraham was, with how great light of vnderſtanding the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye Prophets excelled. with what face than ſhall wee dare ſet out our ſelues before them? are not they rather noble Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, and we Boyes? But let vs paſſe ouer our ſelues. who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Galathians ſhoulde bee founde like vnto anye one of them? but in this place, as I haue already ſayde, hee ſpeaketh not of euery ſinguler perſon, but the generall eſtate of both peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples is deſcribed. Some at the time were furniſhed with more ample giftes, but they were but a fewe, it was not the whole bodye, moreouer, graunt there were many, wee are not to regarde what they were within, but what the gouernmente of GOD was in ruling and ordering them. but it is manifeſt that it was a Scholemayſterſhip, that is to ſaye, a diſcipline for Children. And what is it at this daye? GOD hauing broken thoſe bandes, doth gouerne his Churche more liberallye, and keepeth it not vnder ſo ſtraight a worde although wee muſt by the waye note alſo that notwithſtanding they were endowed with paſſing vnderſtanding yet it ſauoured of the nature of the time, ſo that in the knowledge which they hadde, there remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſomewhat alwayes darke like a cloude. Vppon whiche oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion are theſe wordes of Chriſt, <hi>Bleſſed are the eyes whiche ſee thoſe thinges that you ſee. many Kinges and Prophets haue deſired to ſee thoſe thinges, and yet haue not ſeene them. &amp;c. <hi>Luk. 10.23.</hi>
                  </hi> Now we perceiue howe wee be preferred before them, which paſſed vs very farre. Neyther is that attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the perſons, but the whole dependeth vpon the rule of Gods gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. This is a moſt forcible engine to hurle down all the pompes of ceremonies, with whiche alone the Papacye glittereth. For what other thing at this day doth dazell y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eyes of ſimple people to haue in high eſtimation the kingdome of the Pope, or at the leaſt wiſe to be moued with any reuerence ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, were it not for that pompous ſhew of ceremonyes, cuſtomes, geſtures, and all kind of ſeruice, deuiſed for this purpoſe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſe

I only touch y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> excuſe, wherwith the new craftsmen,<note place="margin">Papiſts he meaneth.</note> couer ſo many abhominations, as it were with a fayre bewtifull colour. Let them, I ſay, obiect, as they will, that there is this daye more rudeneſſe and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in many, that in times paſt was in the Iſraelits: and that therefore they had neede of many helpes. they ſhall neuer proue thereby, that they muſt be gouerned with the like Scholemay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſhip, as was in force among the people of Iſraell. for on the otherſide I will alwayes ſet this agaynſt them, that the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of God is otherwiſe. If they ſay it is expedient or need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, I will ſaye to them that they cannot better iudge what is expedient, than God himſelf. let vs rather hold this as a certen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that that is not only very good but alſo very profitable. that God hath decreede. wherefore vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnlearned there are helps to be ſought, not ſuch as it hath liked men of their own heades to inuent: but ſuch as God himſelfe hath appoynted, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt hath let paſſe nothing that was meete to helpe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie of his. Let this one Buckler ſuffiſe to fende of all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections, It ſeemed good vnto God otherwiſe, whoſe counſayle may ſerue in ſteede of all reaſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> except perhaps that men can deuiſe better helpes, than thoſe which God himſelfe hath proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: whiche afterwardes hee hath done awaye as little worth. And here marke dilligentlye, that Paule in this place doeth not only teache that the yoke which was layd vpon the Iewes, is alreadye taken from vs, that nowe the vſe of ceremonies mighte bee free to vs: but by name doeth put a difference of Gouernment, that GOD woulde haue kepte. I doe graunte in deede, that at this daye all outward thinges are free vnto vs: but ſo that the Churche bee not burthened with a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Ceremonies, excepte wee woulde mingle Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſme with Iudaiſme.

Here is to be noted that in this place the ciuile obſeruation of tymes, whiche is ioyned with the courſe of nature is not condemned. Finallye the courſe of nature is fixed and perpetual. for whereof commeth the reckoning of moneths and yeares, but by the going about of the ſonne and the Moone? what doth make difference betweene ſommer and winter, ſpring and autumne, but the ordinaunce of God? Hee hath promiſed once that it ſhall continue euen vnto the worlds end. Gen. <hi>9.13.</hi> And now ciuile obſeruing (of days) ſerueth as well to huſbandrie, as to politicall and houſholde go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment: yea it is alſo extended to the gouernmente of the Churche. What obſeruation than was it that Paule diſallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? forſooth that which might diſcerne daye from day, as hee ſayth, Rom. <hi>14.</hi> Whan therefore proper holyneſſe is attributed to the dayes by themſelues, when one day is diſcerned from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother for cauſe of religion, when a part of a holy day is deemed
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7611:55"/> a worſhippping of God: than dayes are naughtilye obſerued. The falſe Apoſtles than didde enforce the Sabboth and newe Moones, and the other feſtiuall dayes: becauſe they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruations of the Law. we at this daye whereas we haue diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of dayes, put not on a ſnare of neceſſitie vnto the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, we doe not diſcearne betweene dayes, as though one were holier then another, we do not place in them religion and the worſhipping of God: but only we haue regarde vnto order and concorde.

Hee calleth it a triall or proofe, becauſe the matter was neyther vnknowne, nor obſcure, nor yet of him diſſembled: as men deſirous of glory are accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, who are aſhamed of their baſeneſſe. For it often chaunceth that euen vnto the vnworthye there are giuen great welcoms, before that their bareneſſe be eſpyed: but within three dayes after that, they are ſent away filthilye and with ſhame ynough. but in Paule the matter was cleane otherwiſe, hee beguiled the Galathians with no legerdemayne, but like Tom tell troth hee tolde what he was. <hi>As an Angell of God.</hi> Namely in ſuch reputation as euery true Miniſter of Chriſt oughte to be taken, for as God by the meanes of the Angels doth deſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute his graces vnto vs: ſo alſo by means of God, are godly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters raiſed vp, who miniſter vnto vs that good thing which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue al things is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt excellent, namely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of eternall ſaluation. and therfore not without cauſe are they compared to Angels, by whoſe hands God diſpoſeth vnto vs ſuch a treaſure. moreouer they are verily and in deade the meſſengers of God, by whoſe mouthe God ſpeaketh vnto vs. And this reaſon is had in Mala. <hi>2.7.</hi> He goeth as yet higher by adding (theſe words) <hi>As Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> for the Lorde himſelfe alſo hath commaunded that his miniſters ſhalbe no otherwiſe accounted of, then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. <hi>He that heareth you heareth me: he that diſpiſeth you diſpiſeth me. <hi>Luk. 10.16.</hi>
                  </hi> and no meruaile. for they doe their embaſſade for Chriſt. And therfore they beare his perſon, whoſe turne they ſupply. With ſuche titles or elogies is the maieſtie of the Goſpel commaunded vnto vs: and the miniſterie thereof garniſhed. Wherefore if according to the commaundement of Chriſt, miniſters are ſo to be honoured, it is certen and ſure that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7611:57"/> the deſpiſing of them commeth by the inſtigation of the diuell. and ſurely they cannot be deſpiſed, ſo long as the word is had in eſtimation.

Becauſe therefore that the true image of Chriſte was deformed or miſhapen by ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions brought in of the falſe apoſtles, Paul laboreth about the garniſhing thereof, that it maye ſhine purely without impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7611:59"/> their preaching, but Paule here compareth himſelfe to one in trauayle: becauſe the Galathians were not as yet perfectlye borne. And this is a notable place concearning the efficacie of the miniſterie. It is proper indeede vnto God ſpiritually to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get and to bring forth: but becauſe hee vſeth the miniſter and preaching as inſtrumentes therevnto: he aſcribeth vnto them, that which is his: becauſe that with the indeuour of man, he ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the force of his ſpirite. We muſt always holde faſt that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, that when the miniſter is oppoſed or ſet agaynſt God, he is nothing, and he can doe nothing, but is an vnprofitable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument. but becauſe the holy Ghoſt worketh effectuallye by him, the praiſe and title of the deed is alſo paſſed ouer vnto him. But truely than is not declared of what force the Miniſter is by himſelfe, and apart from God: but what God doth worke by him. Therefore if Miniſters meane to bee any thing, let them ſtudye to ſhape Chriſt and not themſelues. Here as though hee were deade with ſorrowe, hee fayleth in the middeſte of his talke.</p>

For ſuche kynde of fierceneſſe troubled the Godly, and therfore they had neede of comforte, as alſo it was neceſſarye to keepe ſharpelye vnder the falſe Apoſtles. He putteth them in mynde than, that it is no maruayle if the children of the law doe at this daye, that which their Father Iſmaell didde in the beginning, who vexed Iſaac the true heire, which had his byrthrighte, and that his poſteritie with the like boldneſſe now, for outward ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, Circumciſion, and the whole preparation of the law, are ſtoute agaynſt the legitimate children of God, and doe put them to greefe: Agayne hee vſeth the worde Spirite as being contrary to the fleſh: that is to ſay, the calling of God, as being contrarye to the appearaunce of man. ſo hee yeeldeth the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde ſhew to the followers of the Lawe and Workes: but as for the thing it ſelfe, he challengeth it to them who leaue on the onely calling of God. and depende on his grace. <hi>Did perſecute.</hi> There is no mention made in any place of perſecution: onelye Moſes doth ſay that Iſmaell was. with whiche participle hee meaneth that he mocked his brother Iſaac. For in that ſome of the Iewes doe expound it to haue bene but bare laughing, it is not agreeable. for what a rage had it bene, ſo ſharpelye to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge harmeleſſe laughing? There is no doubt than but that in reproche, he prouoked the Infante Iſaac with tauntes. But howe farre is that off from perſecution? yet Paule doeth not amplifie this in vayne or without cauſe. For no perſecution ought to bee ſo grieuous vnto vs, as while wee ſee by the ſkoffes and tauntes of the wicked our calling to be decayed and ſhaken. neither the blowes, nor the whippes, nor the nailes, nor
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7611:63"/> the thornes brought ſo great vexation vnto Chriſt, as that blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie, He truſted in God, what doth it auayle him, ſeing he is deſtitute of all helpe? For there is vnder that more poyſon, then in all perſicutions elſe. for how much more is it, for the grace of the adoption of God to be made voyd than to haue this fraile life taken from vs? Therefore Iſmaell perſecuted not his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſword: but that which was worſe, he proudly ſet vp himſelfe agaynſt him by treading vnder feete the promiſe of God. This alſo is the welſpring of all perſecutions, that the vngodly doe deſpiſe and hate the grace of GOD in the elect, of which matter wee haue a playne and pithie Doctrine in the Storie of Cayne and Abell. Wee are alſo admoniſhed, that not onelye outwarde perſecutions, oughte to bee fearefull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, when as the enimies of Godlineſſe do kill vs with ſworde and fire: when they vexe vs with baniſhmentes, priſonments, tormentes and ſcourginges: but when they goe aboute by theire blaſphemies to make voyde our confidence whiche re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the promiſes of GOD, when they ieaſt at our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, when malapartlye they ſcoffe at the whole Goſpell. For there is nothing that ought ſo greeuouſlye to wounde our hartes as the contempte of GOD, and as mockes agaynſte his grace (oughte to doe): neyther is there any more deadlye kinde of perſecution, than when the Saluatyon of the Soule is aſſayled. The Swordes of the wicked come not at this daye to vs who are deliuered oute of the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannye of the Pope: but howe doltiſhe bee wee, if wee haue no feeling of that ſpirituall perſecution, when they goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout by all meanes to quench that doctrine from which we haue life: when as by their blaſphemies they reſiſt our fayth, yea and perilouſly, batter too the faith of the vnlerned? Truely the furie of the Epycures bringeth more ſorrowe vnto me at this daye, than [that] of the Papiſtes. They inuade not with force and armes: but loke howe much more precious the name of God is vnto mee than mine owne life, (ſo) it cannot bee but that muche more ſorrowefullye am I vexed, when I ſee a diueliſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie to bee made to quenche out all the feare and worſhip of GOD, to banniſhe the memorye of Chriſte, or elſe to

It is a very fine place (to be noted) that we ſhould not bee troubled with the high lookes of hypocrits, or ſhould enuy their caſe, while they haue an honourable manſion or being in the church, although it laſt a but time: but that we ſhould patiently waite the end which bideth them. For many either baſtardes or ſtraunge children vſurpe a roome in the Church: but they haue not a faith that is perpetually fixed. as Iſmaell like a ſtraunge childe was with his poſteritie caſte out, who notwithſtanding was puft vp with his byrthright (as firſt born) and did beare the ſway at the firſte.

For in that Abraham is commaunded vtterly to hearken to his wife that ſurely was extraordinarie. whereby wee gather, that God vſed the miniſterie of Sara to eſtabliſh his promiſe. finallye the caſting out of Iſmaell was nothing elſe but the executing and effect of this Oracle <hi>In Iſaac ſhall thy ſeede be called:</hi> and not in Iſmaell.

By this pretence alſo, the aduerſaries ſtirre vs vp ill will among the vnlearned, as though wee ſeeke nothing elſe but licentiouſneſſe, whiche is a ſetting looſe of all Diſcipline. But they that are wiſe and ſkillfull know, that this is one of the principall poyntes in the doctrine of ſaluation. For here wee deale not aboute this, Whether you may eate this meate or that meate, whether you make this daye holye, or let it alone: (as many men doe fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye ſuppoſe, and ſome men doe ſlaunderouſlye report) but what is lawfull for thee to doe before God, what is neceſſarye to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and what it is wickedneſſe to leaue vndone. to be briefe, it is a contention about the eſtate of the conſcience, when wee come before the tribunall ſeate of God. Finallye Paule in this place meaneth the libertie from the cerimonies of the Lawe, the obſeruing wherof the falſe Apoſtles did exacte as a thinge neceſſarie. But withal the readers muſt remember, that that manner of libertie is but a part only of that libertie, which Chriſte hath purchaſed vnto vs. For howe ſmall a thing were it, if he had onely deliuered vs from the ceremonies? This cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome therefore ſpringeth out of a deaper fountaine: namely in that he was made a curſe, that he might redeeme vs from the curſe of the Law, (aboue in the third chapter verſe <hi>13</hi>). becauſe he hath abrogated the force of the Lawe, as farre forth as it hold vs endaungered by the iudgement of God, vnder the guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of eternal death: to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude becauſe he hath ſet vs at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie from the tyrannye of ſinne, Sathan, and death, ſo vnder one kinde, is the whole comprehended: whereof I wil ſpeake in the Epiſtle to the Coloſſians. Furthermore Chriſt hath purchaſed libertie vnto vs in the Croſſe: but hee giueth vs the fruite and poſſeſſion thereof by the Goſpell. Paule than doeth well when he moniſheth the Galathians, that they be not entangled againe in the yoke of bondage: that is to ſay, that they ſuffer not a ſnare to bee put on their conſciences. for if men will laye a wrongfull burden on our ſhoulders, it may be borne: but
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7611:65"/> if they will bring our conſciences into bondage, wee muſt reſiſt it ſtoutly, and euen to the death For wee ſhall be robbed of an ineſtimable benefite, if men maye binde our conſciences. And withall iniurie ſhall be offred to Chriſt the authour of libertie. But of what force is this, <hi>againe?</hi> for the Galathians neuer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnder the law. It is meant ſimply for this, Euen as though they were not deliuered by the grace of Chriſt. For although the law was giuen to the Iewes, and not to the Gentils: yet without Chriſt there is no libertie to eyther of them, but a mere bondage.</p>

But what meaneth this, That Chriſte auayleth nothing to all that are circumciſed? Did hee auayle Abraham nothing? yea rather that he might auayle, he tooke circumciſion. If wee ſaye that that auayled before the comming of Chriſt, what ſhall we aunſwere concerning Timothie? It muſt be marked that Paul in this place doth not ſpeake of the outward cutting onlye, or of the ceremonie, but rather he reaſoneth agaynſt the wicked doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the falſe Apoſtles, who fayned the ſame to be a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſeruice of God, and withall they did beate in a confidence as it were of a meritorious work. Theſe diueliſh deuiſes did make Chriſt fruitleſſe and vnprofitable. not that the falſe Apoſtles did denye Chriſt, or would haue had him vtterly taken awaye: but they did make ſuche a partition betweene his grace and the workes of the Law, that but onelye halfe parte of our ſaluation ſhould be by him. The Apoſtle cryeth out agaynſte that, ſaying we may not make ſuch a diuiding: nor that otherwiſe hee can auayle vs, except we imbrace him wholy. And what other thing doe the Papiſtes at this daye, but thruſt in trifles inuented by themſelues, in ſtead of Circumciſion? certaynly to this ende is directed their whole doctrine, that the grace of Chriſt ſhould be mingled with the merites of workes: which thing is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For whoſoeuer will haue but halfe Chriſt, ſhall loſe all Chriſt. and yet the Papiſtes ſeeme in their own eyes to be very ſharpe witted, when they alleage that they attribute nothing vnto workes, but by the grace of Chriſt being the meane, as though the Galathians were in any other error. For they did

This ſpeeche, <hi>Behold I Paule,</hi> hath no ſmall force in it: for he doth ſet himſelfe againſte them euen to their face, and he giueth out his name, leſt he ſhould ſeeme to haue a doubtfull cauſe. And although his authoritie began to wax leſſe and leſſe among the Galathians, yet he auoucheth it to be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ouerthrowe all his aduerſaries.</p>

But ſo ſhall it followe, that none of the Fathers were ſaued. Moreouer it ſhall followe that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie was caſt awaye by Paule, when hee was circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For woe to vs, vntill wee bee ſet free from the lawe. and where Circumciſion is, there is ſubiection. It is to bee noted that Paule is accuſtomed to ſpeake two maner of wayes of Circumciſion, and that ſhall bee eaſilye perceyued of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye one that is meanelye excerciſed in the reading of Paule, For to the Romaynes cap. <hi>4.11,</hi> he calleth it the ſeale of the righteouſnes of fayth. and ſo he includeth Chriſte and the free promiſe of ſaluation vnder Circumciſion. Nowe in this place he ſetteth it againſt Chriſte, fayth, the Goſpell, and grace: that it may be a mere couenaunt of the Lawe, hauing the foundation in the merites of workes. hereby is apparaunte that whiche I haue already ſayde, that he ſpeaketh not of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion alwayes one waye: but that we muſt haue regarde of the diuerſitie (therof). I ſay that Paule, whileſt he conſidereth Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion in it owne nature, doth worthely make it a ſymbol or badge of grace: becauſe ſo was the inſtitution of God. but when he hath to doe with the falſe apoſtles, who did abuſe Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Now comes the falſe Apoſtles, and they fayne it to be a meritorious worke: and they ſo ſette out the obſeruing of the law, that they make circumciſion a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or entraunce in of ſuch a profeſſion.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7611:67"/> contemptuouſly of Circumciſion, as though it neuer had anye thing auayled. for mention is not made here of Circumciſion, as in that it was once a Sacrament. it is not demaunded of what force it was at that time in whiche it was not as yet growne out of vſe: but he affirmeth that vnder Chriſtes king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, it was made all one with vncircumciſion. namely for that the comming of Chriſt brought an ende to all the ceremonies of the Law. <hi>But faith working by loue.</hi> He ſetteth agaynſt Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies another excerciſe, namely of loue.

The Papiſtes themſelues like Tormentoures doe teare and rente Fayth miſerablye, while ſometime they make it vnſhaped and without charitie, and ſometime ſhaped. as for vs we holde, that true faith cannot be plucked away from the Spirite of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but when we ſpeake of the cauſe of iuſtification, than we ſhutte oute all workes. As touching this preſence place, Paule doeth not reaſon whether charitie worketh with fayth, to iuſtifie, but onely ſheweth what are now the true excerciſes of the faythfull: leaſt he ſhoulde ſeeme to make Chriſtians idle, and as it were like to blockes. Therefore when you are in hand

In as much as Paule here doeth not entreate of iuſtification, nor yet aſſigneth the prayſe thereof to charitie in part, we may thereby readilye conclude, that by the ſame reaſon it ſhould follow, that Circumciſion and ceremonies did iuſtifie in time paſt. For as he commendeth faith with cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in Ieſus Chriſt: ſo before the comming of Chriſt ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were required.

But Paul doth playnely (ſpeake of) charitie toward our neighbours, than muſt we ſeeke another ſolution that is ſtronger. I graunt that pietie toward God, ſtandeth before loue toward our neighbors: and that therefore the obſeruing or keeping of the firſt table is of more waight in the ſight of God, than of the later. But piety or godlineſſe is a thing hidden from the ſence or vnderſtanding of men: as God himſelfe is inuiſible, and though ceremonyes were ordayned to teſtifie the ſame (I meane godlyneſſe): yet were they no ſure proofes thereof. for often it happeneth that none are more ſtout and buſie obſeruers of ceremonies than bee hypocrites. God therefore will take a triall of our affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him, by our loue toward our brethren, whiche hee ſetteth downe vnto vs one toward another.

Hee commendeth gentleneſſe aboute correcting our bretheren, with another argument, when he ſaith, <hi>Preuented,</hi> for they that are fallen vnaware, or circumue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by deceite, to deale too hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with ſuch, were ſmal humanitie or gentleneſſe. But we know that the Deuill is alwaye readye to deceaue: and that wee are beguiled of him a thouſande maner of wayes. when as therefore wee ſee any of our bretheren fallen let vs thinke that hee is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into the ſnares of Sathan: and let vs be touched with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and withall be the more readye to forgiue. But there is no doubt but he maketh a difference betweene faults or falles, and inward wickedneſſe, which is ioyned with a deliberate and obſtinate contempte of God. Such a wickedneſſe and malitious conſpiring againſt God is to be taken vp more ſeuerelye. for what ſhall gentleneſſe preuayle there? yet the word, <hi>although</hi> which he putteth in, meaneth as much as if he ſhould bid to bee forgiuen, not only the weake which were tempted, but them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo which being tempted continued ſtill therein. <hi>You that are ſpirituall.)</hi> Hee doth not ſpeake ieſtinglye or in mockage: but howſoeuer they were ſpirituall, although they were not vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly filled with the ſpirite, yet it is the duetie of ſuche, to rayſe vp them that are fallen. for to what purpoſe are they better than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but for the ſafetie of their bretheren? for certainely, looke how much more grace anye man is endued with, ſo muche the more is he bounde to them that haue leſſe, to ſpende himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute edifying them. but becauſe we are ſo backwarde, that we doe amiſſe euen in the beſt duties: therefore hee warneth that they mingle withall no iote of the fleſh. <hi>Conſidering theeſelf.)</hi> Not without cauſe hath he altered the number. for it is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall admonition. while he appealeth to euery one of them, and biddeth them looke into themſelues. Thou whoſoeuer thou art, ſayth he, which playeſt the correctour towarde other, looke vpon theeſelfe alſo for nothing is more harde (to be done), than to bring vs to the recounting or examining of our owne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:7611:76"/> infirmitie. Whereas we are more than well ſighted in marking other mens faults: as touching our owne faultes, as Catullus ſayth, We ſee not that ende of the Wallet that hangeth on our backe. therefore to the ende hee maye ſting them the more ſharpelye, he vſeth the ſinguler number. The ſence may be two wayes conſidered. for when wee acknowledge our ſelues to bee ſinfull, the pardon of forgiueneſſe which we would haue to be giuen to vs, wee doe willinglye in like manner giue vnto other. Therefore ſome take the wordes of Paule thus, Shewe not thy ſelfe vnmercifull, or vnintreatable vnto other, who arte theeſelfe a ſinner, and haſte neede of thy brothers mercye. Yet the other Expoſition doeth no leſſe like mee: whereas Paule commaundeth vs to beware, leſt while we correcte other, wee our ſelues offende. For it is a daunger that principallye wee muſt beware of, and yet verye hardelye can wee beware of it: becauſe nothing is more readye then to paſſe meaſure. You may take, <hi>tempted,</hi> for the preſent matter, or if you will, you maye extende it to the preſent matter, or if you will, you maye extende it to the whole life. We muſt be mindfull than to begin at our ſelues, as oft as we mynd to correcte vices: that remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring our own infirmitie, we may beare the more with others.</p>

For nature doeth not teache vs to helpe thoſe that are ouerloded. He biddeth vs beare their burthens, not that we ſhould by fauouring or diſſembling nouriſh thoſe euils wherewith our bretheren are wayed downe, but rather that we ſhould vnburden them. and that is done with friendly and gentle correccions or rebukinges. For there are many adulterers, whiche willinglye woulde make Chriſt their baude: manye Theeues which willinglye would make Chriſte their Receiuer: to conclude, there are manye wicked naughtye packes of all ſortes, whiche willinglye woulde make him their patrone: and all (they) woulde laye their burthens vppon the ſhoulders of the faythfull that they ſhoulde beare them.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7611:77"/> word Law while it is fitted to Chriſte, ſerueth to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce of the reaſon. For there is a contrarietie betweene the law of Chriſt and that of Moſes: as if he ſhould ſaye, If it bee a pleaſure to you to obſerue the Law: loe, Chriſt doth preſcribe vnto you a Lawe, which it becommeth you to preferre before all lawes and that worthilye: namely that wee ſhoulde holde mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall humanitie among our ſelues. For hee that hath not this, hath nothing. on the contrarye ſide hee ſayth the Lawe of Chriſt is fulfilled, whereas euery one eaſeth his brother with mercye. whereby hee ſheweth that all thinges are ſuperfluous which belong not to charitie: for the compoſition of the Greeke worde expreſſeth a ſounde and firme fulfilling. But becauſe no man perfourmeth in all reſpects that which Paule requireth, therefore we are farre off all of vs from perfection: and he that is leaſt of all off in compariſon of others, yet in reſpect of God is very farre off.</p>

Firſte therefore hee pronounceth vs to bee nothing: whereby he meaneth, that we haue nothing our owne of which wee maye boaſt: but to be voyde of all goodneſſe, that all our boaſting may be meere vanitie. Secondely he gathereth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that they deceaue themſelues who challenge any thing vnto themſelues. and it is a very abſurde thing, wheras we take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more in dogen, than to be mocked of others, that willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we our ſelues will mock our ſelues. The thinking vpon this will make vs much more fauourable vnto others. for whereof commeth fierce triumphing ouer other, whereof commeth ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeueritie: but of this that euery man extolleth himſelfe and diſdainefully deſpiſeth others? take arrogancie out of the way, and we ſhall all be very modeſt one to another.</p>

Let no man, ſayeth he, meaſure himſelfe by another mans free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, nor like of himſelfe therefore, becauſe hee more miſliketh other than himſelf. but leauing the view of other, let him ſearch his owne conſcience: and conſider what his owne worke is. That is true prayſe, not which we get vs by backbiting others: but which we haue without compariſon. Some thinke it is an Ironia as though Paule ſhould ſay, Thou flattereſt thy ſelfe becauſe of other mens faultes: but if thou looke vpon thy ſelfe who thou art, than ſhall thou haue the prayſe that longes to thee, that is none at all: becauſe there is no man that deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a drop of prayſe. Afterwarde they expounde that whiche followeth Euery man ſhall carrie his owne burthen, as thus, Is accuſtomed to beare. &amp;c.

I know why the Ironia liketh them, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe the Apoſtle in the next ſentence hath broughte to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing all the glory of men.

Such an occaſion of prayſe doe the Godlye finde in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, which they aſcribe, not to their merites, but to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God.

He accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth than the falſe Apoſtles of ambition, as if hee ſhoulde ſay, Will yee knowe what maner of fellowes they bee, whiche laye vppon you the neceſſitie of Circumciſion? what they ſhoote at? what they hunt after? you are deceaued, if you thinke them to bee mooued with any Godly zeale: but their mynde is to get or elſe to mayntayne the fauoure of men by this recompence. For whereas they were Iewes, they meant by this meanes to keepe ſtill the good will of their Nation, or at the leaſte to eſcape theyr hatred. So for the moſte parte are the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious accuſtomed, by flattering like Slaues thoſe by whoſe fauoure they hope they maye eſcape: they creepe into theire hartes, to the ende that when they haue caſte downe better than themſelues, they may play rex alone.

                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:7611:81"/> Agayne he calleth the Croſſe of Chriſte, the pure preaching of the Goſpell, but he alludeth to their daintineſſe, in that they would teache Chriſte without the Croſſe. For this was the cauſe why the Iewes were moued with ſo hatefull a rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſte Paule, for that they coulde not abide his falling awaye from ceremonies. theſe therefore (I meane the falſe Apoſtles) did flatter the Iewes, to the ende they mighte eſcape perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But if they had themſelues kept the Lawe, it hadde bene the more to be borne withall: but they troubled the whole Church for their owne quietneſſe ſake: they made no ſtoppe at it to laye a tyrannicall yoke vpon conſciences, that they might ſcape ſcot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>free from bodily vexation.

The meaning than is thus, They doe not this for the zeale of the Law, in that they binde you with the yoke of ceremonies. for with their Circumciſion they kepe not the Law. With pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the Law they require you to be circumciſed: but wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they themſelues are circumciſed, they performe not that which they inioyne to others. But there ariſeth a doubt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he ſayth <hi>They keepe not the Law,</hi> whether hee meant it of the whole law, or elſe of ceremonies. for there are ſome that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde it thus, They truely fulfill not the Law, becauſe it is a burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not able to be born, but he rather accuſeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of falſhood, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they would quietly paſſe ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, as oft as enuie was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye, which plague ſpreadeth it ſelfe abroad alſo in euery place. for at this daye you ſhall finde many who defend the Popiſhe ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannye through ambition rather than of conſcience. I ſpeake of the Court Apoſtles, and them that loue their bellies. they will pronounce as it were out of an Oracle that the ſtatutes of the holy church of Rome are reuerently to be obſerued and kepte. And what doe they the whileſt? they ſet no more by all the holy decrees of Rome, than by the braying of an aſſe: but they will ſaue one. To be brefe, ſuch controuerſie had Paule with thoſe deceuers, as we haue at this day with the counterfeit profeſſors
